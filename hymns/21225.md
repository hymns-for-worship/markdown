### Verse 1

Hear, O LORD, and answer; I am poor and needy. Guard my life for I am devoted to You. Hear my prayer, O LORD, And my cry for mercy. In this day of trouble I will call to You. Hear, O LORD; answer my prayer. Guard my life for I am Yours. Hear my prayer, LORD, and my cry! In trouble I will call to You. I will praise You, I will praise You, Glorify Your name, O LORD. I will praise You, I will praise You, Glorify Your name, O LORD. Hear, O LORD, and answer; I am poor and needy. Guard my life for I am devoted to You. Hear my prayer, O LORD, And my cry for mercy. In this day of trouble I will call to You. Hear, O LORD, Hear, O LORD. Hear, O LORD, my humble prayer. Hear, O LORD, Hear, O LORD. Hear, O LORD, and answer me.
