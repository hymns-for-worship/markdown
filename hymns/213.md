# 213 - Here We Are But Straying Pilgrims

## Notation

G - 2/2 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here we are but straying pilgrims, here are path is often dim, but to cheer us on our journey, still we sing this wayside hymn:

### Verse 2

Here our feet are often weary on the hills that throng our way; here the tempest darkly gathers, but our hearts within us say:

### Verse 3

Here our souls are often fearful on the pilgrims lurking foe; but the Lord is our defender, and He tells us we may know:

### Chorus

Yonder over the rolling river, where the shining mansions rise, soon will be our home forever, and the smile of the blessed giver, gladens all our longing eyes.
