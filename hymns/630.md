### Verse 1

 Watch and pray, for the Lord is coming, Coming in the clouds some day; Wash your robes in the cleansing fountain, Watch, O watch and pray.

### Verse 2

 He may come in the early morning, He may come at close of day; Watch and pray, in His promise trusting, Watch, O watch and pray.

### Verse 3

 When He comes He'll reward the faithful, What a glorious day 'twill be; Joy awaits those who have made ready, Watch, O, watch and pray.

### Chorus

Watch and pray, watch and pray, For we know not the hour when the Lord shall come; Watch and pray, watch and pray, And be ready to enter the soul's bright home.
