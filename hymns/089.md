# 089 - Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, Savior, pilot me over life's tempestuous sea; unknown waves before me roll, hiding rock and treach'rous shoal; chart and compass came from Thee: Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

### Verse 2

As a mother stills her child, Thou canst hush the ocean wild; boistrous waves obey Thy will when Thou say'st to them, "be still!" Wondrous Sov'reign of the sea, Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

### Verse 3

When at last I near the shore, and the fearful breakers roar 'twixt me and the peaceful rest, then, while leaning on Thy breast, may I hear Thee say to me, "fear not, I will pilot thee."
