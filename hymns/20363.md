## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just beyond the rolling river, Lies a bright and sunny land; Where the saved with Christ are dwelling, A united happy band.

### Verse 2

Soon we'll cross the rolling river, Soon we'll join the happy band; There to dwell with Christ forever In that holy happy land.

### Verse 3

When we've crossed the rolling river, To that land beyond the tide; Pearly gates on golden higes, Will be standing open wide. 

### Chorus

Just beyond the rolling river, In that land so bright and fair; We will dwell with Christ forever; Over there, yes, over there.
