## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, You read my very heart, You who know the least thing; You who see me from afar, sleeping or arising. Lord, before me and behind, infinite and ageless. Such a knowledge is too high, I cannot atain it. How wonderful, how marvelous, how mighty are You, God. The darkness is as light to You, how boundless are Your ways. 

### Verse 2

If to heaven I would fly, You would be beside me; If in Sheol I would lie, even there You'd find me. If I fled on morning wings, far beyond the gray sea. Even there Your hand would lead, Your right hand would guide me. How wonderful, how marvelous, how mighty are You, God. The darkness is as light to You, how boundless are Your ways. 

### Verse 3

In the secret of the womb, I was formed and molded; By Your skillful hand alone, wonderfully woven. You have numbered all my days long before You gave them. In the pages of Your book, they have all been written. How wonderful, how marvelous, how mighty are You, God. The darkness is as light to You, how boundless are Your ways. 

### Verse 4

High and wondrous are Your tho'ts, vast beyond all telling; If I count them they grow more, I can never grasp them. Search me, God, and know my heart, let evil nev-er find me. Lead me on Your righteous path, How wonderful, how marvelous, how mighty are You, God. The darkness is as light to You, how boundless are Your ways.
