## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Wonderful angels in garments of white, Came to the shepherds one beautiful night, Singing a song of surpassing delight— Praise to God on high.



### Verse 2

O, what a song was that song from the sky, Never such glory did shepherds discry, Never had heaven before been so nigh, Praising God on high.

### Verse 3

Birth of a Savior the angels proclaimed, "City of David" and "Jesus" were named— Then was the word of peace sweetly acclaimed, Praising God on high.


### Verse 4

Never those shepherds forgot what they heard: Strongly and deeply their hearts had been stirred; Seeking for Jesus— they heeded the word— Praising God on high.

### Chorus

Glory, glory, O, glory to God on high! Glory, glory, Yes, glory to God on high!
