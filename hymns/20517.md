# 20517 - LIKE A STAR OF THE MORNING

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a star of the morning in its beauty, Like a sun is the Bible to my soul, Shining clear on the way of love and duty, As I hasten on my journey to the goal.

### Verse 2

Tis a light in the wilderness of sorrow, And a lamp on the weary pilgrim way; And it guides to the bright, eternal morrow, Shining more and more unto the perfect day.

### Verse 3

It shall stand  in its beauty and its glory, When the earth and the heavens pass away, Ever telling the blessed, wondrous story Of the loving Lamb, the only Living Way.

### Chorus

Holy Bible! My precious Bible! Gift of God, and lamp of life, my beautiful Bible! I will cling to the dear old holy Bible, As I hasten to the city of the King.
