## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One holy church of God appears, Thru ev'ry age and race, Unwasted by the lapse of years, Unchanged by changing place.

### Verse 2

One book to guide the pilgrim's feet, Unerring counsel give; Instructions so divine, complete, How God would have us live.

### Verse 3

One name by which each one is known From heav'n divinely giv'n One way that leads the saints of God To joys and bliss in heav'n.

### Chorus

There shall be one fold, one shepherd. "One Lord, one hope, one faith." There shall be one fold, one shepherd, One plan of saving grace!
