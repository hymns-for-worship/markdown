## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God will bless the brokenhearted, And His goodness I will see; Tho' my dreams have all departed, He is near to comfort me. Standing here amid the rubble Where my earthly hopes had soared,
I will turn to Him in trouble; This time, I will praise the Lord.

### Verse 2

Now I see my former blindness; Now I see my plans were vain, Yet in God is lovingkindness, And His promises remain. With His grace, He will anoint me; With His hand, He will reward; He will never disappoint me; This time, I will praise the Lord.

### Verse 3

For the gifts that He has given, For the gifts He will not give, I will praise the God of heaven; I will share in Him, and live. In the joy of pres-ent blessing, In the hope of loss restored, By my faith, I come confessing; This time, I will praise the Lord.
