## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My soul is now rejoicing, I'm free of ev'ry sin. I'm part of that great fam'ly, My Jesus took me in. I'm sure within His graces, That's why I smile today. There's joy within my very soul, I'm in the glory way. 

### Verse 2

Yes, I'm within His kingdom, And joyful is the theme; And joyfully I'm saying That Jesus is my King.  He truly is my Master, The Holy One up there. He touched my soul this very day, Removing ev'ry fear. 




### Verse 3

I've learned about my Master, I've learned about His blood. I've learned about immersion And felt the cleansing flood. I know about the angels Rejoicing high above, I've known about my Master's grace, And felt His wondrous love.
