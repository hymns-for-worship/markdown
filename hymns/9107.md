## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Known before the world; Seen in future days; Glimpsed by righteous men; Son of God. Sent as David's heir; Named an ageless king; Granted all the earth. Exalted.

### Verse 2

Seen with blinded eyes; Heard by heedless ears; Met with wicked hearts; Son of God. Worshipped with contempt; Crowned with blood and thorns; Throned upon a cross. Exalted.

### Verse 3

Scorned by those who watched; Mocked by all the wise; Loved within belief; Son of God. Born to take my death; Slain to give me life; Jesus , Son of God. Exalted. Exalted.
