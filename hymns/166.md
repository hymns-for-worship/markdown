## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Why did My savior come to earth and to the humble go? Why did He choose a lowly birth? Because he loved me so!

### Verse 2

Why did he drink the bitter cup of sorrow pain and woe? Why on the cross be lifted up? Because he loved me so!

### Verse 3

Till Jesus comes I'll sing His praise, and then to glory go, and live with Him thru endless days, because he loved me so!

### Chorus

He loved me so; He loved me so; He gave His precious life for me, for me, because he loved me so.
