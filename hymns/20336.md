## Notation

F - 4/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole; There is a balm in Gilead to heal the sinsick soul. Sometimes I feel discouraged, And think my work's in vain, But then the Holy Spirit Revives my soul again.

### Verse 2

There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole; There is a balm in Gilead to heal the sinsick soul. If you can't sing like angels If you can't preach like Paul, Then tell the love of Jesus, And say He died for all.
