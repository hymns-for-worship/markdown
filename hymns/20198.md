## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hear me when I call, O God, my righteousness, Unto Thee I come in weakness and distress; Hold my trembling hand, lest helpless I should fall O hear me, Lord, hear me, O hear me when I call!

### Verse 2

Hear my cry, O God, attend unto my prayer, More and more I need Thy mercy and Thy care; Clouds of doubt arise and faith grows weak and small, O hear me, Lord, hear me, O hear me when I call!

### Verse 3

Hear my voice, O God, and cleanse my soul within ,Mercy do I need for all my doubts and sin; Only in Thy grace I trust my all in all, O hear me, Lord, hear me, O hear me when I call!

### Verse 4

Hear my prayer, O God, I need Thy cleansing power, Let me feel Thee near each moment of each hour; Hold my trembling hand, lest helpless I should fall, O hear me, Lord, hear me, O hear me when I call!
