# 133 - The Banner Of The Cross

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a royal banner given for display to the soldier of the King; as an ensign fair we lift it up today, while as ransomed ones we sing.

### Verse 2

Over land and sea, wherever man may dwell, make the glorious tidings known; of the crimson banner now the story tell, while the Lord shall claim His own.

### Verse 3

When the great Commander from the vaulted sky, sounds the ressurection day, then before our King the faint and foe shall die and the saints shall march away.

### Chorus

Marching on and on! Marching on and on! For Christ counts anything but loss, for the king of Kings, we'll toil and sing beneath the banner of the cross.
