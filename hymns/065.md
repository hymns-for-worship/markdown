## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Master, let me walk with me in lowly paths of service free; tell me Thy secret; help me bear the strain of toil, the fret of care.

### Verse 2

Help me the slow of heart to move by some clear, winning word of love; teach me the wayward feet to stay, and guide them in the homeward way.

### Verse 3

Teach me Thy paience! Still with Thee in closer, dearer company, in work that keeps faith sweet and strong, in trust that triumphs over wrong.

### Verse 4

In hope that sends a shining ray far down the future's broad'ning way, in peace that only Thou canst give, with Thee, o Master, let me live.
