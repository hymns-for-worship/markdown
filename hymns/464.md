## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Precious mem'ries, unseen angels, Sent from somewhere to my soul; How they linger, ever near me, And the sacred past unfold.

### Verse 2

 In the stillness of the midnight, Echoes from the past I hear; Old time singing, gladness bringing, From that lovely land somewhere.

### Verse 3

 As I travel on life's pathway, Know not what the years may hold; As I ponder, hope grows fonder, Precious mem'ries flood my soul. 

### Chorus

Precious mem'ries, how they linger, How they ever flood my soul; In the stillness of the midnight, Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
