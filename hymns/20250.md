## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As a sheep before the shearer, as a lamb before the slaughter, He was sacrificed in death.

### Verse 2

He was mocked, accused, and beaten, hearing shouts of  "Crucify Him," He was led away to death.

### Verse 3

He was silent. He was silent. He had put us in God's keeping, He had prayed His love be in us, Then He poured Himself to death, in the silence of His Spirit.
