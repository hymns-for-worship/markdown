### Verse 1

I love the shining city Where war and sorrow cease, Where reigns the God of heaven, Where dwells the Prince of peace.

### Verse 2

I've trusted in the promise Of His eternal grace, The Sabbath rest awaits me Within His dwelling place.

And to that weight of glory, What suff'ring can compare? So here I'll make the journey; My Lord will claim me there.
