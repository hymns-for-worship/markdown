### Verse 1

I've a home prepared where the saints abide, just over in the glory land; and I long to be by my savior's side, just over in the gloryland.

### Verse 2

I am on my way to those mansions fair, just over in the gloryland; there to sing God's praise and His glory share, just over in the gloryland.

### Verse 3

With the bloodwashed throng I will shout and sing, just over in the gloryland; glad hosannas to Christ the Lord and King, just over in the gloryland.

### Chorus

Just over in the gloryland, I'll join the happy angel band, just over in the gloryland; just over in the gloryland, there with the mighty host I'll stand, just over in the gloryland.
