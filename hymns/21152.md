## Lyrics

### Verse 2

O how sweet 'twill be to meet them All the ransomed host above; Sweeter still to see the Savior, Praise Him for redeeming love.

### Verse 3

Tho the world is filled with sorrow, And the teardrops often fall, There will be but joy and gladness, Safe inside the jasper wall.

### Verse 1

 O the blessed contemplation, When with trouble here I sigh: I've a home beyond the river, That I'll enter by and by.

### Chorus

I've a home beyond the river, I've a mansion bright and fair; I've a home beyond the river I will dwell with Jesus there.

### Verse 4

Tho the hills are rough and stony, and the valleys dark and cold, I must walk the path before me It will some day turn to gold.
