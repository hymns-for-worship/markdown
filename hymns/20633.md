## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord, I now address You, and tell You I can't see, How You could give Your precious life for a human wretch like me. But if it would be possible to thank You face to face, I would give a million worlds like this to be with You in that place.

### Verse 2

Please hear my pray'r, My Savior, and please don't make it long, Till I can live and share with You the feelings of this song. 'Cause I'm so weak and sinful O, who else could plead my case I would give a million worlds like this to be with You in that place.

### Verse 3

Be kind to me, O Father, when Judgment Day draws near. I'll serve You and I'll praise Your name while I am waiting here. And if I could be honored just to gaze upon Your face I would give a million worlds like this to be with You in that place. I would give a million worlds like this to be with You in that place.
