### Verse 1

God incarnate, can it be? Poder now the mystery: He, the Fount of Eternal Life, Must drink the cup of mortality. Immanuel, God with us.

### Verse 2

Shepherds wonder at the scene: Swaddling robes for Deity; Heaven's throne now a bed of straw Within these borrowed stable walls. Immanuel, God with us.

### Verse 3

God Creator, now created, Lord of all in infancy. Hands that lighted the evening stars Reach out for comfort in Mary's arms. Immanuel, God with us. Our God with us.
