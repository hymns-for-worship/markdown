## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When the trumpet shall sound, And the dead shall arise, And the splendors immortal Shall envelope the skies, When the angel of death Shall no longer destroy, And the dead shall awaken In the morning of joy.

### Verse 2

 When the King shall appear, In His beauty on high, And shall summon His children To the courts of the sky, Shall the cause of the Lord Have been all your employ, That your soul may be spotless In the morning of joy?

### Verse 3

 O the bliss of that morn When the saved ones we meet, With the songs of the ransomed We each other shall greet, Singing praise to the Lamb, Thru eternity's years, With the past all forgotten With its sorrows and tears.  

### Chorus

In the morning of joy, In the morning of joy, We'll be gathered to glory In the morning of joy.
