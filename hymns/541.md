## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Draw Thou my soul, O Christ, closer to Thine; Breathe into ev'ry wish Thy will divine; Raise my low self above won by Thy deathless love; O Christ, thru mine let Thy life shine. 

### Verse 2

 Lead forth my soul, O Christ, one with Thine own, Joyful to follow Thee thru paths unknown; In Thee my strength renew; Give me Thy work to do; Thy truth be shown, Thy love made known.

### Verse 3

 Not for myself alone may my prayer be; Lift Thou Thy world, O Christ, closer to Thee; Cleanse it from guilt and wrong; Teach it salvation's song, Till earth fulfill God's holy will.
