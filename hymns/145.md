## Notation

G - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God's grace, his power, his might and his love, he sent in the savior from heaven above, who died on the tree for sinners like me; my soul doth rejoice that salvation is free.

### Verse 2

His word is giv'n for us to obey, so we can reach heaven some wonderful day, as sanctified ones on that heavenly shore, we'll praise his dear name with the saved evermore.

### Verse 3

Our Lord, he's king, he's prophet and priest, he reigns now in heaven o'er great and o'er least; he's coming again to take his saints home, to dwell with him there 'round his glorious throne.

### Chorus

Wondrous grace, heavenly grace, wondrous love, from above, greatest power in his word that mortal have heard. Wondrous hope, for us all, man redeemed from the fall oh, what grace, wondrous grace for all.
