 Though my cross may be hard to bear, Tho' my life may be filled with care; Tho' misfortune be mine to share

### Verse 2

 Though the tempter in efforts bold, Or in subtlety as of old, Should essay to allure my soul I'll never forsake my Lord.

 Though so helpless I cannot see What the future may hold for me; Jesus knows and my guide will be
