## Notation

Ab - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How blest are they who, fearing God, From sin restrain their feet, Who will not with the wicked stand, Who shun the scorner's seat. 

### Verse 2

How blest are those who make God's law Their treasure and delight, And meditate upon that word With gladness day and night.

### Verse 3

Their lives are nourished like a tree Set by the river's side; Its leaf is green, its fruit is sure, So all their works abide.

### Verse 4

The wicked, like the driven chaff, Are blown across the land; They shall not gather with the just Nor in the judgment stand.

### Verse 5

The LORD will guard the righteous well; Their way to Him is known; The way of sinner, far from God, Shall surely be o'erthrown.
