## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thou art merciful, O Father, Full of pity, love and grace; Thou wilt not forever chasten, Nor in anger hide Thy face. High as heaven, vast and boundless, Hath Thy lovingkindness been; Far as east from west is distant Hast Thou put away our sin.

### Verse 2

Like a Father's tender pity Is God's mercy toward His own; For He knows our frame, rememb'ring We are dust, our days soon gone. Like a flower blooming, fading, Like the grass, we pass away; But God's righteousness and mercy On His children rest alway.

### Verse 3

In the heavens, well established, Is His universal throne; For His kingdom ruleth ever, And His sway all kings shall own. Bless Jehovah, ye His angels, Bless Him, hosts of His control, Bless Jehovah, all His creatures, Bless Jehovah, O my soul!
