## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Grace! 'Tis a charming sound, Harmonious to the ear; Heav'n with the echo shall resound, Heav'n with the echo shall resound, And all the earth shall hear, And all the earth shall hear, And all the earth shall hear.

### Verse 2

Grace first contrived a way To save rebellious man; And all the steps that grace display, And all the steps that grace display, Which drew the wondrous plan, Which drew the wondrous plan, Which drew the wondrous plan.

### Verse 3

Grace led our wand'ring feet To tread the heav'nly road; And new supplies each hour we meet, And new supplies each hour we meet, While pressing on to God, While pressing on to God, While pressing on to God.

### Verse 4

Grace all the work shall crown Thru everlasting days; It lays in heav'n the topmost stone, It lays in heav'n the topmost stone, And well deserves our praise, And well deserves our praise, And well deserves our praise.
