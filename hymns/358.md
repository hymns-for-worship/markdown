## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep, From which none ever wakes to weep! A calm and undisturbed repose, Unbroken by the last of foes.

### Verse 2

 Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet To be for such a slumber meet! With holy confidence to sing, That death hath lost its venomed sting.

### Verse 3

 Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest, Whose waking is supremely blest! No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour That manifests the Savior's pow'r.
