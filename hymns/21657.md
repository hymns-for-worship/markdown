## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We must be the reflection, Called to be light in the world; And when we look in the mirror, Should see the face of the Lord.




### Verse 2

We must be the reflection, Example for men to see, The glory of our dear Savior Who lived and then died for me. 

### Verse 3

We must be the reflection Of what Christ taught us to give; We do things good, right and holy That all the lost ones may live. 



### Verse 4

We must be the reflection That's clearly seen by the world; That sinners won't follow blindly, Be saved by God's holy word.
