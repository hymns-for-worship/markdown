## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How great a love my Lord  has shown, That I be reconciled, That He should be my Father now And I should be His child.

### Verse 2

I know that if I hope in Him And bid that hope endure, Then I shall purify myself Just as my God is pure.

### Verse 3

I cannot know what I shall be, But still His Word is true, That I shall see Him as He is And shall be like Him too.
