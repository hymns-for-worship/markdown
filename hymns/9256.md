### Verse 1

In true communion with our Lord, We hear His word in one accord, His word is spirit, truth and life, To cleanse our souls of sin and strife.

### Verse 2

In true communion with our Lord, We pray thru Him in one accord. He knows our wants, He knows our needs, On our behalf He intercedes.

### Verse 3

In true communion with our Lord, We sing with Him in one accord, With songs of faith and hope and love, We lift our praise to God above.

### Verse 4

In true communion with our Lord, We sup with Him in one accord. The feast we keep in memory Of Christ the Lamb of Calvary.

### Amen

Amen.
