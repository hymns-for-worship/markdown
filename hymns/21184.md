### Verse 1

Shepherd of love, You knew I had lost my way; Shepherd of love, You cared that I'd gone astray. You sought and found me, placed around me Strong arms that carried me home; No foe can harm me or alarm me Never again will I roam! Shepherd of love, My Savior and Lord and Guide, Shepherd of love, Forever I'll stay by your side.
