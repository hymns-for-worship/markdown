### Verse 1

I love to hear the stories that Jesus taught His friends. His stories help me understand how He wants me to live.

### Verse 2

The end we know is coming. So we must be prepared. Just like the five wise virgins, the wedding joy they shared.

God's given us some talents and we know what they're for. If we will do our very best He'll give us many more.
