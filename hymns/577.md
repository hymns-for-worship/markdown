## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Soldiers, who are Christ's below, Strong in faith resist the foe; Boundless is the pledged reward Unto them who serve the Lord. 

### Verse 2

 'Tis no palm of fading leaves That the conqu'ror's hand receives; Joys are his, serene and pure, Light that ever shall endure.

### Verse 3

 Passing soon and little worth are the things that tempt on earth; Heav'nward lift your soul's regard; God Himself is your reward.

### Verse 4

 Father, who the crown doth give, Savior, by whose death we live, Spirit, who our hearts doth raise, Three in One, Thy name we praise.
