## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The sands have been washed in the footprints Of the Stranger on Galilee's shore — And the voice that subdued the rough billows Will be heard in Judea no more. But the path of that lone Galilean With joy I will follow today; And the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way; And the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way. 

### Verse 2

 There are so many hills to climb upward, I often am longing for rest; But He who appoints me my pathway, Knows just what is needful and best.  I know in His word He hath promised That my strength "it shall be as my day;" And the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way; And the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way. 

### Verse 3

 When the last feeble step has been taken, And the gates of that city appear, And the beautiful songs of the angels Float out on my listening ear; When all that now seems so mysterious Will be bright and as clear as the day; Then the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way; And the toils of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way.
