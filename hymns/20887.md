## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On Calv'ry's brow my Savior died, 'Twas there my Lord was crucified; 'Twas on the cross He bled for me, And purchased there my pardon free.

### Verse 2

Mid rending rocks and dark'ning skies, My Savior bows His head and dies; The op'ning vail reveals the way To heaven's joys and endless days.

### Verse 3

O, Jesus, Lord, how can it be, That Thou shouldst give Thy life for me, To bear the cross and agony,In that dread hour on Calvary.

### Chorus

O, Calvary! dark Calvary! Where Jesus shed His blood for me; for me; O, Calvary! blest Calvary! 'Twas there my Savior died for me.
