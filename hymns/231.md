## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Soldiers of christ arise and put your armour on, strong in the strength which God supplies, strong in the strength which God supplies through His beloved son.

### Verse 2

Strong in the Lord of hosts and in his mighty power, who in the strength of Jesus trusts, who in the strength of Jesus trusts is more than conquerer.

### Verse 3

Stand then in His great might with all his strength endued, but take to arm you for the fight, but take to arm you for the fight the panoply of God.

### Verse 4

Leave no unguarded place, no weakness of the soul, take every virtue every grace, take every virtue every grace and fortify the whole.

### Verse 5

That having all things done and all your conflicts past, you may o'ercome through christ alone, you may o'ercome through christ alone and stand entire at last.
