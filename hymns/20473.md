### Verse 1

Love sent my Savior to die in my stead, Why should he love me so? Meekly to Calvary's cross He was led, why should He love me So?

### Verse 2

Nails pierced His hands and his feet for my sin, Why should He love me so? He suffered sore my salvation to win. Why should He love me so?

### Verse 3

O how He agonized there in my place, Why should he love me so? Nothing witholding my sin to erase, Why should he love me so?

### Chorus

Why should He love me so? Why should He love me so? Why should my Savior to Calvary go? Why should he love me so?
