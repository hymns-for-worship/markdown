## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Washed in the blood of Calvary. Cleansed and made whole, salvation tion free; There on the cross He purchased me, Now I'm plunged 'neath the blood of Calvary.

### Verse 2

Life stained with sin and burdened soul, He washed me clean and made me whole; I once was lost but now I'm free, But I'm plunged 'neath the blood of Calvary.

### Verse 3

Love was the key that won my heart, Redeeming grace He did impart; Raised now to live eternally, Singing praises to Him for Calvary. 

### Chorus

Washed in the blood of Calvary, I've been redeemed, He set me free; Once I was blind but now I see, I'm washed in the blood of Calvary.
