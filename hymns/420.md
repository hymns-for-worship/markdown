## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O Thou Fount of ev'ry blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;  Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise; Teach me ever to adore Thee; May I still Thy goodness prove; While the hope of endless glory, Fills my heart with joy and love. 

### Verse 2

 Here I raise my Ebenezer:  Hither by Thy help I've come; And I hope by Thy good pleasure Safely to arrive at home; Jesus sought me when a stran-ger,  Wand'ring from the fold of God; He to rescue me from danger Interposed His precious blood.

### Verse 3

O to grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be! Let Thy goodness like a fetter Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee; Never let me wander from Thee, Never leave the God I love; Here's my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.
