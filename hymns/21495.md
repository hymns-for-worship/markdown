### Verse 1

All along on the road to the soul's true abode, There's an Eye watching you; Ev'ry step that you take this great Eye is awake, There's an Eye watching you. 













### Verse 2

As you make life's great flight, keep the pathway of right, God will warn not to go in the path of the foe, 
There's an Eye watching you. 

### Verse 3

Fix your mind on the goal, that sweet home of the soul, Never turn from the way to the kingdom of day, There's an Eye watching you.  



### Chorus

Watching you, watching you,  Ev'ry day mind the course you pursue; Watching you, watching you, There's an all seeing Eye watching you.
