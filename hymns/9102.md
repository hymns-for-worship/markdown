### Verse 1

Father free my life of darkness; make it be a light for Thee. Let my hands be swiftly working; let the world see Christ in me.

### Verse 2

Change my heart to be sincerely filled with love for things above. Let my voice tell unsaved sinners of my Savior's cross of love.

### Verse 3

Let my eyes read words of wisdom from Thy holy word divine. Help me store Thy word in my heart; let Thy will be ever mine.

### Verse 4

When my life on earth is over, let me rest in Paradise. May my life say to the living: follow Christ will make you wise.
