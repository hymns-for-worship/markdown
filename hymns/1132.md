## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Somewhere, so far o'er yonder, So far beyond and even further, Than man may know, There I'll be going. My Lord will send for me and I will surely go.

### Verse 2

Somewhere there's glory blooming, In bowers green, beyond all gloaming, Where longings cease My soul contented. I've but to wait, For soon or late He'll beckon me.

### Verse 3

O isle, thou isle of Somewhere, O land beyond yon dreaded river. I look to thee, My eyes not seeing, But faith in thee hath made me see thy graciousness.

### Coda

O isle, thou Isle of Somewhere, O land beyond yon river.
