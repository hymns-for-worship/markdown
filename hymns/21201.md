## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Word of God incarnate, O Wisdom from on high, O Truth unchanged, unchanging, O Light of our dark sky, We praise You for the radiance That from the hallowed page, A lantern to our footsteps, Shines on from age to age.

### Verse 2

The church from Thee, her Master, Received the gift divine, And still that light she lifteth O'er all the earth to shine: It is the sacred body Where Life and Truth are stored; It is the heav'n drawn picture Of Thee, the living Word.

### Verse 3

It floateth like a banner Before God's host unfurled; It is a shining beacon Above the darkling world. It is the chart and compass That o'er life's surging sea, 'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands, Still guides, O Christ to Thee.

### Verse 4

O make Your church, dear Savior, A lamp of purest gold, To bear before the nations Your true light as of old. O teach Your wand'ring pilgrims By this their path to trace, Till, clouds and darkness ended, They see Thee face to face.
