### Verse 1

Come, Thou long expected Jesus, Born to set Thy people free. From our fears and sins release us; Let us find our rest in Thee.Israel's Strength and Consolation, Hope of all the earth Thou art; Dear Desire of ev'ry nation, Joy of ev'ry longing heart!

### Verse 2

Born Thy people to deliver, Born a child and yet a King. Born to reign in us forever, Now Thy gracious kingdom bring. By Thine own eternal Spirit Rule in all our hearts alone; By Thine all-sufficient merit, Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
