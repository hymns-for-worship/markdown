## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Bless Thou the gifts our hands have brought; Bless Thou the work our hearts have planned; Ours is the faith, the will, the thought; The rest, O God, is in Thy hand.

### Verse 2

Thine is the bounty of each day, And Thine, when we return it still, So we can only give and pray That is should work as Thou dost will.

### Verse 3

And when we sow Thy Word, we know It is Thy harvest we shall see; We plant Thy seeds and help them grow, But all the increase comes from Thee.

### Verse 4

Almighty God, pour out Thy love And give our offering success: Without Thine aid, we cannot move, But we will serve if Thou wilt bless.
