## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father, guide me over there. Father, hear my feeble pray'r. Ever lend Thy list'ning ear While I'm walking over here.

### Verse 2

Bless me now, frail child of Thine, By Your grace divine, not mine. Humbly at Thy feet I bow, Help me, Father, help me now.

### Verse 3

Lord, I give mself to Thee Evermore Thy child to be. Thru my pray'rs I'll keep Thee near "Precious child" from Thee I'll hear.

### Chorus

Forgive me Lord, my sins I bring, To Thy feet, my Holy King. Grant that I may ever be In Thy heav'nly home with Thee.
