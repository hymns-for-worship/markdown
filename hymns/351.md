## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If the name of the Savior is precious to you, If His care has been constant and tender and true, If the light of His presence has brightened your way, O will you not tell of your gladness today?

### Verse 2

If your faith in the Savior has bro't its reward, If a strength you have found in the strength of your Lord, If the hope of a rest in His palace is sweet, O will you not, brother, the story repeat?

### Verse 3

If the souls all around you are living in sin, If the Master has told you to bid them come in, If the sweet invitation they never have heard, O will you not tell them the cheerbringing word?

### Chorus

O will you not tell it today? Will you not tell it today? If the light of His presence has brightened your way, O will you not tell it today?
