# 20823 - CORNERSTONE

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My hope is built on nothing less, than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.

### Verse 2

When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the vale.

### Verse 3

When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found. Dressed in his righteousness alone. Faultless to stand before the throne.

### Chorus

Christ alone. Conerstone. Weak made strong in the Savior's love. Thru storm, He is Lord. Lord of all
