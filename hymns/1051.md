# 1051 - How Deep His Love

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How deep His love, and great the shame, that for my sins, Christ bore such pain. And those who would, the story tell; Must see His cross, To teach it well.

### Verse 2

How deep His love, with broken heart; to bear my sins, from God, did part. Labor of soul, God, satisfied; When His own Son, was crucified.

### Verse 3

How deep His love, how sweet His care, That one so vile He makes His heir. See from His cross, love flowing down; And I so worthless can wear a crown.

### Verse 4

How deep His love, Lord help me see; That all my sins, Bring shame to Thee. And how His death, did open the way; For love so deep, I must obey.
