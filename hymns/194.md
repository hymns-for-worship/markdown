## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy and His grace; in the mansions, bright and blessed, he'll prepare for us a place.

### Verse 2

While we walk the pilgrim's pathway, clouds will overspread the sky; but when traveling days are over not a shadow, not a sigh.

### Verse 3

Let us then be true and faithful, trusting, serving, everyday; just one glimpse of Him in glory will the toil of life repay.

### Chorus

When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! When we all see Jesus we'll sing and shout the victory.
