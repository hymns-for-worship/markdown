## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent word! What more can he say than to you he has said, you, who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

### Verse 2

Fear not I am with thee, o be not dismayed; for I am thy God and will still give thee aide; I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

### Verse 3

The soul, that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, I will not I will not desert to his foes; that soul, tho all hell should endeavor to shake, I'll never, no never, no never forsake.
