## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There is a sea which day by day, Receives the rippling rills, And streams that spring from wells of God, Or fall from cedared hills;  But what it thus (But what it thus) receives it gives (receives it gives) With glad unsparing (With glad unsparing) hand (unsparing hand;) A stream more wide, (A stream more wide,) with deeper tide, (with deeper tide,) Flows on (Flows on, flows on) to lower land. (to lower land.) 

### Verse 2

 There is a sea which day by day, Receives a fuller tide; But all its store it keeps, nor gives To shore nor sea beside; Its Jordan's stream (Its Jordan's stream) now turned to brine (now turned to brine) Lies heavy as mol(Lies heavy as molten) ten lead; (as molten lead;) Its dreadful name doth e'er proclaim that sea is waste and dead. (Its dreadful name) (doth e'er proclaim) (That sea, that sea) (is waste and dead.)

### Verse 3

 Which shall it be for you and me, Who God's good gifts obtain? Shall we accept for self alone, Or take to give again? For He who once (For He who once) was rich indeed (was rich indeed) Laid all His glo(Laid all His glory) ry down; (His glory down;) That by His grace the ransomed race Should share His wealth and crown. (That by His grace) (the ransomed race) (Should share should share) (His wealth and crown.)
