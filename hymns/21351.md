## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come, let our souls adore the Lord Whose judgments yet delay, Who yet suspends the lifted sword And gives us time to pray.

### Verse 2

Great is our guilt, our fears are great, But let us not despair; Still open is the mercy seat To penitence and prayer.

### Verse 3

Kind Intercessor, to Thy love This blessed hope we owe; O let Thy mercies plead above, While we implore below!

### Verse 4

Though justice near Thy awful Throne Attends Thy dread command, Lord, hear Thy servants, hear Thy Son, And save a guilty land.
