## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

So softly and tenderly, graciously speaking, The voice of the Savior is heard here below By souls who are hungry and yearn His appearing, By all those desiring His goodness to know.

### Verse 2

As soft as the moonbeams o'er mountains arising, As grand as the sunlight thru dawn breaking fair, Are also the ways of my Lord in His beauty; How fine are His blessings I see ev'rywhere.

### Verse 3

Lord, I am a child in great need of Your keeping; Without You I'd falter and soon lose my way, Defiling my soul in the darkness about me, Except You enlighten and guide me each day.

### Verse 4

You see, Lord, what's needful before I may know it; Let Your will be my own may Your ways I see. Become my true Master I'll honor no other And be a defender, a refuge for me.
