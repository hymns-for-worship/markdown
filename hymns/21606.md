## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Praise the Lord who reigns above and keeps His court below; Praise the holy God of love, and all His greatness show; Praise Him for His noble deeds, praise Him for His matchless pow'r; Him from whom all good proceeds let earth and heav'n adore.


### Verse 2

The Lord reigns, the earth be glad, Let distant shores rejoice. Heav'n proclaim His righteousness; The fields be jubilant. Great is the Lord in Zionâ€” praise Your great awesome name. He has made salvation known, with joy, good news proclaim.


### Verse 3

God, in whom they move and live, let ev'ry creature sing, Glory to their Maker give, and homage to their King. Hallowed be His name beneath, as in heav'n on earth adored; Praise the Lord in ev'ry breath, let all things praise the Lord.
