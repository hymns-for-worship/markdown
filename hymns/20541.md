## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I know that my redeemer lives, And living cares for me; I know eternal life He gives, And gave on Calvary.

### Verse 2

I know the promise cannot fail The hour is drawing nigh; Tho' cruel death my flesh assail, My soul shall never die.

### Chorus

O 'twas wonderful, wonderful love, That bro't Him from heaven above, As a ransom to die on the tree, To save a poor sinner like me.

### Verse 3

I know my mansion He prepares, Beside the crystal sea, That where He lives and loves and cares, There I may ever be.
