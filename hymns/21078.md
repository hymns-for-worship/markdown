## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Loved with everlasting love, led by grace that love to know; Gracious Spirit from above, Thou hast taught me it is so! O, this full and perfect peace! O, this transport all divine! In a love which cannot cease, I am His and He is mine; mine.

### Verse 2

Heav'n above is softer blue, earth around is sweeter green; Something lives in ev'ry hue Christless eyes have never seen! Birds with gladder song o'erflow, Flow'rs with deeper beauties shine, Since I know, as now I know, I am His and He is mine; mine.

### Verse 3

Things that once were wild alarms cannot now disturb my rest; Closed in everlasting arms, Pillowed on the loving breast. O to lie forever here, Doubt and care and self resign, While He whispers in  my ear, I am His and He is mine; mine.

### Verse 4

His forever, only His; Who the Lord and me shall part? Ah, with what a rest of bliss Christ can fill the loving heart! Heav'n and earth may fade and flee, Firstborn light in gloom decline; But while God and I shall be, I am His and He is mine; mine.
