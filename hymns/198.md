# 198 - An Empty Mansion

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here I labor and toil as I look for a home just a humble abode among men, while in heaven a mansion is waiting for me and a gentle voice pleading "come in."

### Verse 2

Ever thankful am I that my savior and Lord promised unto the weary sweet rest; nothing more could I ask than a mansion above, there to live with the saved and the blest.

### Verse 3

When my labor and toiling have ended below and my hands shall lie forlded in rest, I'll exchange this old home for a mansion up there and invite the archangel as guest.

### Chorus

There's a mansion now empty, just waiting for me, at the end of life's troublesome way, and I know the the savior will welcome me there near the door of that mansion some day.
