## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, let thy Spirit permeate This heart and soul of mine; And my whole Being with Thy grace Pervade, O Life divine!

### Verse 2

As this clear air surrounds the earth, Thy grace around me roll; As the fresh light pervades the air, So pierce and fill my soul.

### Verse 3

As from these clouds drops down in love The precious summer rain, So from Thyself pour down the flood That freshens all again.

### Verse 4

As these fair flow'rs exhale their scent In gladness at our feet, So from Thyself let fragrance breathe, More heav'nly and more sweet.

### Verse 5

Thus life within our lifeless hearts, Shall make its glad abode; And we shall shine in beauteous light Filled with the light of God.
