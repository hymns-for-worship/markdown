## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Jesus, my Savior, look on me, For I am weary and oppressed; I come to cast myself on Thee: Thou art my Rest.

### Verse 2

 Look down on me, for I am weak; I feel the toilsome journey's length; Thine aid omnipotent I seek: Thou art my Strength.

### Verse 3

 I am bewildered on my way, Dark and tempest'ous is the night; O send Thou forth some cheering ray! Thou art my Light. 

### Verse 4

 Thou wilt my ev'ry want supply, E'en to the end, whate'er befall; Thru life, in death, eternally, Thou art my All.  

### Coda

Amen.
