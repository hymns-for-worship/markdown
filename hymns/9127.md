## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, I cannot fully know, For children understand in part, But as I follow you, I grow. I learn the language of Your heart.

### Verse 2

As I attempt to walk with You, I see the love in all Your ways, My joy and love are kindled too. I find a richer voice of praise.

### Verse 3

But only in that hymn above, Before the glories of Your throne, May I approach Your endless love, And know, as I am fully known.
