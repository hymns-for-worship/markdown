## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O how kindly has Thou lead me, Heav'nly Father, day by day; Found my dwelling, clothed and fed me, Furnished friends to cheer my way! Didst Thou bless me, didst Thou chasten, With Thy smile or with Thy rod, 'Twas that still my step might hasten Homeward heav'nward to my God.


### Verse 2

O how slowly have I often Followed where Thy hand would draw! How Thy kindness failed to soften! How Thy chast'ning failed to awe! Make me for Thy rest more ready, As Thy path is longer trod; Keep me in Thy friendship steady, Till Thou call me home, my God.
