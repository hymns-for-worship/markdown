## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, make in me an undistracted mind. Clear from my eyes the cares that leave me blind. Tear from my heart the thorns that choke my love; Help me to set my mind on things above. 

### Verse 2

Lord, make in me an undistracted mind. Renewed, transformed, and with Your will aligned. Remind my soul, when stressed by many things: One thing I need the portion Jesus brings. 

### Verse 3

Lord, make in me an undistracted mind. Help me press on and leave the past behind. One thing I do: reach forward to the goal, Each thought restrained and under Your control. 

### Verse 4

Lord, make in me an undistracted mind. Fill it with thoughts for which it was designed. Teach me Your love surpassing human thought; Lead me to You, my God whom I have sought.
