# 20909 - PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let us pray for one another, Helping thus the weakest stand; For Â the conflict with the tempter Strengthening both heart and hand.

### Verse 2

Let us in the hour of trial, When a brother's faith seems weak, That he yet may prove victorious, On our knees his name oft speak.

### Verse 3

Let us pray in faith believing, Ever trusting undismayed; Knowing He will send the answer, Tho' in wisdom long delayed.

### Verse 4

Let us cheer our homeward journey, By sweet fellowship in pray'r; Thus the law of Christ fulfilling, Thus each others' burdens bear.

### Chorus

Let us pray for one another, God will our petitions hear; He delights to have His children To the throne of grace draw near.
