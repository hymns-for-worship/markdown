### Verse 1

Praise to God, the everlasting One, Maker of the earth and sun. Wondrous grace and mercy overflows And all goodness He bestows.

Praise to Christ, the Savior of our souls; Thru His blood, He makes us whole. By His pow'r and love we have been healed; He is now our hope and shield.

### Verse 3

Praise the Spirit, Comforter within, Guarding hearts and minds from sin. Bounteous blessings given ev'ry day guide us on the narrow way.

Praise the Father, praise the heav'nly Son, Praise the Spirit, three in One. Faithful, joyful, thankful hearts we raise, Off'ring praises ev'ry day!
