## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are a people of God's plan: to be a glory of His praise. He reconciled us by His Hand and through deep darkness, made the Way. Through Him, oppression melts in light where sin has lost a thousand strifes, when Christ arises in his might and lead us forth to show his life. O God, be glorified in me.

### Verse 2

Created in Your righteousness and made to glorify Your name. Transformed to live in holiness to be presented without blame. His radiance then shines forth in me and all made perfect by the Lamb. Reflecting Him, then men may see the everlasting God, "I AM." O God, be glorified in me.
