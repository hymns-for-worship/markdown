## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Earth holds no treasures but perish with using; however precious they be; yet there's a country to which I am going: heaven holds all to me.

### Verse 2

Out on the hills of that wonderful country, happy, contented, and free, angels are waiting and watching my coming: heaven holds all to me.

### Verse 3

Why should I long for the world and its sorrows, when in that home o'er the sea, millions are singing the wonderful story? Heaven holds all to me.

### Chorus

Heaven holds all to me, brighter the glory will be; joy without measure will be my treasure: heaven holds all to me.
