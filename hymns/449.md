## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus came down from heaven, Doing His Father's will; He gave His life a ransom There upon Calv'ry's Hill.

### Verse 2

Jesus arose triumphant Over the grave for me; He took away the death sting, Christ won the victory.

### Verse 3

Jesus went back to heaven  To intercede above; O what a great Redeemer, Sharing with me His love.

### Verse 4

 Jesus will come from heaven And ev'ry eye shall see; Saved ones He'll bless forever In heav'n eternally.

### Chorus

Now I believe in Jesus, E'en tho' I did not see His nailscarred hands, His wounded side; Jesus is dear to me.
