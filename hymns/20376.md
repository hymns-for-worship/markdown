## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Chorus

O Savior, stay this night with me, Behold tis even tide!

### Verse 1

Abide with me, 'tis eventide! The day is past and gone, The shadows of the evening fall, The night is coming on! Within my heart a welcome guest, Within my home abide;

### Verse 2

Abide with me, 'tis eventide! Thy walk today with me, Has made my heart within me burn, As I communed with Thee. Thy earnest words have filled my soul And kept me near Thy side.

### Verse 3

Abide with me, 'tis eventide! And lone will be the night, If I cannot commune with Thee, Nor find in Thee my light. The darkness of the world, I fear, Would in my home abide;
