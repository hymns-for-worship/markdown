# 21355 - LIKE AN ONLY CHILD

## Notation

F - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm nothing that you would call special, Just one soul of many, you see; But He marks the death of each sparrow, And He said He'd watch over me. 

### Verse 2

It simply, to me, is amazing To think that it really could be, Of all the hosts under heaven That He still would care about me.

### Chorus

I'm only one in a million, A grain of sand by the sea; But He knows each step; each breath that I take, And He loves me like an only child; O, He loves me like an only child.
