## Notation

G - 2/2 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once Jehovah created a man on earth, Wrapped his spirit in pure flesh and blood; But my Lord has promised that when we die, We can live immortal above.

### Verse 2

As our time flies away and the years go by, We are all growing older each day; But my Lord has promised that I'll be changed, Nevermore to die or decay.

### Verse 3

There are times when we don't feel like going on, There are days when the pain is so strong; But my Lord has promised a day of rest, Live with courage, It won't be long!

### Chorus

We will be transformed up in our new home, In the presence of our Lord, we will all rejoice; We will be transformed in the blessed presence of our Lord. When this life is o'er, We will be transformed.
