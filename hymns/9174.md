### Verse 1

My spirit rejoices in Jesus, My night has been turned into day; My sins are forgiven, they're washed away; I'm singing through all the day. Yes, He's a Friend, so faithful and true; He's made my life all new;

### Verse 2

My cup overflows with His goodness; He's bountif'ly blessed me, I know; He's patient and kind, and I love Him so; I'm singing as on I go. Yes, He's a Friend, who'll always be near;  A Friend who'll always hear;

### Verse 3

I'm happy to wrok for my Master, To serve is a priv'lege to me; He died for my sins, and he set me free; I'll sing though eternity. Yes, he's a Friend who meets ev'ry need; Yes, He's a Freiend indeed;

### Verse 4

Some day we'll be with Him in heaven, We'll rise when He comes for His own; With heavenly joy we'll sing on and on; Our songs will surround His throne. Yes, He's a Friend who'll always be there; His love He'll always share;
