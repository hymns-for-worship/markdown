## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Are you weary, are you heavy hearted? Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus; Are you grieving over joy departed? Tell it to Jesus alone.

### Verse 2

Do your tears flow down your cheeks unbidden? Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus; Have you sins that to man's eye are hidden? Tell it to Jesus alone.

### Verse 3

Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow? Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus; Are you anxious what will be tomorrow? Tell it to Jesus alone.

### Chorus

Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus; He is a friend that's well known; You have no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.
