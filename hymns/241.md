# 241 - The Gates Swing Outward Never

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just a few more days to be filled with praise and to tell the old, old story; then, when twilight falls, and my savior calls, I shall go to Him in glory.

### Verse 2

Just a few more years with their toil and tears, and the journey will be ended; then I'll be with Him, where the tide of time with eternity is blended.

### Verse 3

What a joy twill be when I wake to see Him for whom my heart is burning! Never more to sigh, never more to die, for that day my heart is yearning.

### Chorus

I'll exchange my cross for a shining crown, where the gates swing outward never; at His feet I'll lay every burden down and with Jesus live forever.
