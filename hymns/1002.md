# 1002 - Higher Ground

## Notation

A - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm pressing on the upward way, new heights I'm gaining every day; Still praying as I onward bound, Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

### Verse 2

My heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay. Tho' some may dwell where these abound, my prayer my aim is higher ground.

### Verse 3

I want to scale the utmost height, and catch a gleam of glory bright. But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found; Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

### Chorus

Lord, lift me up and let me stand, by faith on heaven's table land. A higher plane than I have found; Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
