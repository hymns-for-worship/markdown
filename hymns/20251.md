## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like the woman at the well I was seeking For things that could not satisfy. And then I heard my Savior speaking: "Draw from my well that never shall run dry!"

### Verse 2

There are millions in this world who are craving The pleasure earthly things afford. But none can match the wond'rous treasure that I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord.

### Chorus

Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more, Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

### Verse 3

So, my brother, if the things this world gave you Leave hungers that won't pass away, My blessed Lord will come and help you,  Turn your heart to Him and humbly pray:
