## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O new child of Jesus how glorious, To leave the dark pathway behind. To follow the path straight and even, Where love and salvation you'll find.

### Verse 2

By faith in our Lord are you risen From sin by the blood of the Lamb. All hath been made well in your being, By none but the Gracious "I AM."

### Verse 3

O new child of Jesus how precious, Your soul in the eyes of our King. The angels rejoice high up yonder, The heavens with gladness doth ring.

### Chorus

You've cast away the ways of the world, You've cast off the darkness of sin. Adorn now the Spirit of truth. Serve none but our Lord to the end.
