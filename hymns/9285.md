## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

For vict'ry over Satan's wiles, Put on the armor of our God. Let's pray always thru the battle trials; Put on the armor of our God.

### Verse 2

Your waist with truth all girt about; Your righteous breastplate so devout. Your feet shod with the gospel peace; let none flag, nor the battle cease.

### Verse 3

Strong faith is your heart's  greatest shield, To foil the darts the devil wields. Salvation's helmet will defend; With Spirit's sword, God's message send.

### Chorus

Stand fast then soldiers of the Lord,  Let not the wicked host prevail. Be strong in his power and in His might. God's armor will not fail.
