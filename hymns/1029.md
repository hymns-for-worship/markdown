## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your name; Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your name.

### Verse 2

You are my strength when I am weak, You are the Treasure that I seek, You are my all in all; Seeking You as a precious jewel, Lord, to give up I'd be a fool; You are my all in all.

### Verse 3

Taking my sin, my cross, my shame, Rising again I bless Your name; You are my all in all; When I fall down, You pick me up, When I am dry, You fill my cup; You are my all in all.

Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your name; Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your name.
