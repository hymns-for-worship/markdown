# 072 - Be With Me, Lord

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be with me, Lord, I cannot live without Thee, I dare not try to take one step alone; I cannot bear the loads of life, unaided, I need Thy strength to lean myself upon.

### Verse 2

Be with me, Lord, and then if dangers threaten, if storms of trial burst above my head; if lashing seas leap everywhere about me, they cannot harm or make my heart afraid.

### Verse 3

Be with me, Lord, no other gift or blessing, Thou couldst bestow could with this one compare; a constant sense of Thy abiding presence, where'er I am to feel that Thou art near.

### Verse 4

Be with me, Lord, when loneliness o'ertakes me, when I must weep amid the fires of pain, and when shall come the hour of "my departure" for "worlds unknown," o Lord, be with me there.
