## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, enthroned in heav'nly splendor, First begotten from the dead, You alone, our strong defender, Now lift up Your people's head. Here we kneel, our homage paying, Here in loving re'rence bow; Here for faith's discernment praying, Lest we fail to know You now.

### Verse 2

Tho' the lowly form may veil You As of old in Bethlehem, Here as there Your angels hail You, Branch and flow'r of Jesse's stem. Paschal Lamb, Your off'ring finished Once for all when You were slain, In its fullness undiminished Shall forevermore remain.

### Verse 3

Great High Priest of our profession, Thru the veil You entered in, By Your mighty intercession, Grace and peace for us to win. Lifeimparting heav'n-ly manna, Smitten rock with streaming side, Heav'n and earth with loud hosanna Worship You, the Lamb who died.
