## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a river you come flooding thru the desert of my heart; And like the wind, You come rushing, blowing life thru every part; And like the snow, You're falling on me with the blood of Your own Son; And like the sun, You come shining, making darkness run.

### Verse 2

Like a river You come pouring out Your love upon the field; And like the wind, You bring harvest down to take Your yield; And like the snow, You come to winter touching hearts and making warmth; And like the sun, You raise a mighty light to calm the storm.

### Chorus

Like a river flowing down to the sea, Like a rushing wind You blow into me. Like the falling of the snow, Like the blood that makes me whole, Is the love of God that flows into me.
