## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Fear not, tho' your foes be countless, And the contest fierce and long; In Jehovah's might triumphant, Ye shall sing the victor's song.



### Verse 2

All that now they boast as glory, At the last shall be their shame; God shall battle for His people, And His own most righteous name.



### Verse 3

Sons of Zion then take courage, See the crowns that wait for you! See the glories of the future, Ever bright'ning to the view!



### Verse 4

Sing then, till ye sing in heaven, Where no sin can mar your joy; Glorious is the great Jehovah, He shall all our foes destroy.
