## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once more I must tell the old story to you, The story that I love; The story of Jesus so good and so blest, How He came His love to prove.

### Verse 2

Once more I must tell the old story to you, 'Tis pleasant to repeat The marvelous story of Christ and His love, The story true and sweet.

### Verse 3

I tell it because it is what the world needs More than all else besides; I tell it because He to you and me came, And with us still abides.

### Verse 4

I tell it because I cannot restrain His love that fills my soul; I tell it because in His mercy He came And made me fully whole.

### Chorus

Once more I must tell it, Once more I must tell it, Once more I must tell the old story so true; Once more I must tell it, Once more I must tell it, Once more I must tell it to you.
