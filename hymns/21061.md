## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just over the river, just over the river, I'm told is the city of God; Its gates are of pearl and its streets are of gold And by glorified beings they're trod; And Jesus, my Savior, has gone to that city, A place for His own to prepare; In the house of the Father the mansions are many, And one is awaiting me there.

### Verse 2

Just over the river, just over the river, The city that knoweth no night; It needeth no sun, neither needeth the moon, For the glory of God is its light; In that city are saved ones awaiting my coming, Expectant they stand on the shore; O when shall I enter my mansion in heaven, A pilgrim to roam never more?

### Verse 3

Just over the river, just over the river, I'm told is the city of God; Where the feet of His children its streets of pure gold Shall forever in ecstacy trod; For Jesus, my Savior, has gone to that city, A place for His own to prepare; In the house of the Father, the mansions are many, And one is awaiting me there.

### Chorus

Just over the river, That beautiful city I see; Just over the river, A place in that city for me.
