## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I saw a pretty rainbow yonder; It seemed to reach from there to there. Why did its beauty overwhelm me? Was it the colors made me stare? Doth not its purpose linger onward, Up there among the clearing sky? Doth not it say, "I still remember?" O Lord, My Lord, You make me cry.

### Verse 2

O yes, I saw its awesome archway. I saw it fade as rainbows do. But not before its wondrous message, Came once again to me and you. And once again I stood reminded, That life will have its glory day. To briefly bloom as doth a rainbow, To briefly bloom then fade away.
