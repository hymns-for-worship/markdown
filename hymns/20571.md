### Verse 1

The more we read the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, The more we read the bible, the happier we'll be. We learn about Jesus and how we may please Him; The more we read the bible, the happier we'll be. 

### Verse 2

The more we keep on singing, keep singing, keep singing, The more we keep on singing the happier we'll be. We'll sing about Jesus the songs that will praise Him; The more we keep on singing, the happier we'll be.
