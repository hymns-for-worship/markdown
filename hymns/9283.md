## Lyrics

### Verse 1

E'er soft in His voice, as the wind in the trees, And heard thru the ages, nor lost as a breeze. Sustaining the weary by grace from above, And all who would know Him shall know of His love.

### Verse 2

That story unfolds, as the saint's voices ring, For love of our Savior, our voices take wing; And glad is my soul when we gather to sing Of Him gone before: Praise His name, O my King.

### Verse 3

In boasting our Savior, our voices shall blend, With hearts swelled to bursting, as love takes us in. We'll sing that old story revealed long ago, And wait His appearing; He's coming, I know.
