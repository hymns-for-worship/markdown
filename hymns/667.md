## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I hold to the hand of my Savior and friend, He shields me from evil till dangers all end, He'll take me to heaven where voices now blend;

### Verse 2

 I hold to His hand when the stormclouds arise, He speaks and the shadows roll back from the skies, 'Tis wonderful glory for our human eyes;

### Verse 3

 I hold to the hand that is steadfast and sure, No other foundation is ever secure, I look for the home that will ever endure; 

### Chorus

I hold to the hand of my Savior and King, Till safe in that city where angels now sing; He leads me so gently where pure waters flow, And tells me of heaven where I long to go.
