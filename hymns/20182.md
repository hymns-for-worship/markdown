## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ev'ry promise we can make, Ev'ry prayer and step of faith, Ev'ry diff'rence we will make, Is only by His grace. Ev'ry mountain we will climb, Ev'ry ray of hope we shine, Ev'ry blessing left behind, Is only by His grace.

### Verse 2

Ev'ry soul we long to reach, Ev'ry heart we hope to teach, Ev'ry where we share His peace, Is only by His grace. Ev'ry loving word we say, Ev'ry tear we wipe away, Ev'ry sorrow turned to praise,Ev'ry tear we wipe away, Ev'ry sorrow turned to praise, Is only by His grace.

### Chorus

Grace alone, which God supplies, Strength unknown, He will provide, Christ in us our cornerstone, We will go forth in grace alone.
