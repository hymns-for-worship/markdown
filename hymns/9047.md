## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Softly, so softly, You come in the silence and gather each prayer in Your Hand. Then so Gently, so gently, revealing Your beauty, Your glory You spread across the Land.

### Verse 2

Softly, so softly, You come here beside me, and lift my heart heavy with sin; Then so Gently, so gently, You cleanse all its pieces, until I am pure and whole again.

### Chorus

Peace is not in the thunder that rolls 'cross the mountains. It is not in the lightning, the rain You release, But deep in communion is mercy and comfort, and within Your presence, there is peace.
