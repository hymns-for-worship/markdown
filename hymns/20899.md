# 20899 - ON JORDAN'S STORMY BANKS, I AM BOUND

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, And cast a wishful eye. To Canaan's fair and happy land, Where my possessions lie.

### Verse 2

All o'er those wide extended plains, Shines one eternal day. There God, the Son forever reigns, And scatters night away.

### Verse 3

No chilling winds nor pois'nous breath, Can reach that healthful shore. Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, Are felt and feared no more. 

### Verse 4

When shall I reach that happy place, And be forever blessed?  When shall I see my Father's face, and in His bosom rest?

### Chorus

I am bound, I am bound, I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the promised land.
