## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once, forth to meet the bridegroom, At night ten virgins went; Five lamps were trimmed for burning, In five the oil was spent. And while they slept and slumbered, At midnight rose the shout: Behold the bridegroom cometh, To meet him go ye out.

### Verse 2

Then all the foolish virgins their need began to tell; And all the wise ones answered, Go ye to them that sell. The foolish virgins hastened, in darkness, fear, and shame; the wise ones ready waited, And lo, the bridegroom came!

### Verse 3

Lord, Lord, unto us open, The foolish virgins cried; "I know ye not," unto them The bridegroom's voice replied. O Christians, learn the lesson, Your lamps be wise and trim, And when the Bridegoom cometh, Go gladly in with Him.

### Chorus

Watch ye, therefore, watch I say. Watch ye, therefore, watch and pray; Ye know not the hour, ye know not the day The Son of Man may come.
