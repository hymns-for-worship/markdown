## Lyrics

### Verse 3

O Savior mine, can I withhold The trifling deed, the paltry gold? Nay, lowly at Thy feet I fall; O Savior mine, I give Thee all.

### Verse 2

O Savior mine, Thy feet to kiss In service low is highest bliss; O give to me one glance of Thine, And pain for Thee is joy divine. 

### Verse 1

O Savior mine, so full, so free, Thy pard'ning love has been to me; Were I possessed of boundless store, My heart would long to yield Thee more. 

### Chorus

The world is naught apart from Thee, O Savior mine, And crust are kingly fare for me since I am Thine; My life, my all, to Thee I give, O Savior mine, for Thee to live; My life, my all, to Thee I give, O Savior mine, for Thee to live.
