## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God of Grace and God of glory, On Thy people pour Thy pow’r. Crown thine ancient church’s story; Bring her bud to glorious flow'r. Grant us wisdom; Grant us courage for the facing of this hour, For the facing of this hour.



### Verse 2

Lo! The host of evil round us, Scorn I Christ, assail His ways! From the fears that long have bound us, Free our hearts to faith and praise. Grant us wisdom; Grant us courage For the living of these days, For the living of these days.



### Verse 3

Cure Thy children warring madness; Bend our pride to Thy control. Shame our wanton, selfish gladness, Rich in things and poor in soul. Grant us wisdom; Grant us courage Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal, Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.



### Verse 4

Set our feet on lofty places; Gird our lives that they may be Armored with all Christlike graces, In the fight to set man free. Grant us wisdom; Grant us courage That we fail not man nor Thee, That we fail not man nor Thee.
