### Verse 1

We are walking by faith and not by sight, willing to serve our Lord aright, knowing the will of God, above; that the greatest of all is love.

We are filled with the hope of heaven's grace, longing to see my savior's face, knowing some day when He shall come; he has promised to bear us home.
