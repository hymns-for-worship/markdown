## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rejoice with me, my people, Lift high your hearts in song; My spirit lives with Jesus, To Jesus I belong. I honored my Redeemer, His will I did obey, And lived by His commandment, Who led me in His way.

### Verse 2

No sin, no pain, no sorrow Can shadows on me cast; No more in flesh I suffer, I'm truly free at last. Earth's thorny paths forsaken, Celestial ways I tread, In company with Jesus, My Savior and my Head.

### Verse 3

I know I am forgiven, God's promises are true; Lord Jesus died to free me, And surely died for you. Rejoice with me, my people, And live, more to rejoice, As free at last in heaven, To praise with perfect voice.
