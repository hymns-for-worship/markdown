## Notation

G - 4/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place, And I know that it's the Spirit of the Lord; There are sweet expressions on each face, And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

### Verse 2

There are blessings you cannot receive 'Til you know Him in His fullness and believe; You're the one to profit when you say, "I am going to walk with Jesus all the way."

### Chorus

Sweet Holy Spirit, Sweet heavenly dove, Stay right here with us, Filling us with Your love; And for these blessings We lift our hearts in praise; Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived, When we shall leave this place.
