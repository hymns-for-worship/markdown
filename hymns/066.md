## Lyrics

### Verse 1

This is my daily prayer, God bless you, go with God, hold fast His mighty hand, thruout the day; His grace your heart sustain, His pow'r relieve your pain, Your prayer be not in vain, as you travel His way. In spite of all the lies, that some may hurl, Christ is the only hope of all the world; God bless you, go with God, thru all eternity, My prayer will always be, may you go with God. In spite of all the lies, that some may hurl, Christ is the only hope of all the world; God bless you, go with God, thru all eternity, my prayer will always be,  may you go with God, may you go with God.
