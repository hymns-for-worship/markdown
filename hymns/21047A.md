## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Why do the rivers flow into the sea? Because God made it so. And why at dawn do stars all flee! Because God made it so.

### Verse 2

Why does the rain fall on valleys below? Because God made it so. And why do mountain peaks gather snow? Because God made it so.

### Verse 3

Why must a fish live his life in the sea? Because God made it so. And why in blue skies do birds I see? Because God made it so.

### Chorus

Because God made it so. Because God made it so. And giv'n to us is salvation free?  Because God made it so.
