# 158 - Nailed To The Cross

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There was one who was willing to die in my stead, that a soul so unworthy might live; and the path to the cross He was willing to tread, all the sins of my life to forgive.

### Verse 2

He is tender and loving and patient with me, while He cleanses my heart of its dross, but there's no condemnation, I know I am free, for my sins are all nailed to the cross.

### Verse 3

I will cling to my savior and never depart, I will joyfully journey each day, with a song on my lips and a song in my heart, that my sins have been taken away.

### Chorus

They are nailed to the cross, they are nailed to the cross, o how much he was willing to bear! With what anguish and loss, Jesus went to the cross! But he carried my sins with Him there.
