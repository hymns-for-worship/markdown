## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I love the Lord, for He died my soul to save, On Calvary His dear life He freely gave; From realms above, jesus freely came to die, That I might live someday with Him on High.

### Verse 2

I love the Lord, for He saved the lost from sin, He gave them life to be whole and free again; To live on high, with Him nevermore to die, O, praise His name, we'll see Him by and by.

### Verse 3

I love the Lord, for His love so full and free, He taught us why that our love like His should be; To be like Him, and compassion freely give, O, bless His name, we then with Him could live.

### Chorus

I love the Lord, He has been so good to me. He gave his life, from sin to set me free; No greater love than His could ever be, I love the Lord, because He first loved me.
