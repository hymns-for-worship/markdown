## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One of these days I'll be with Jesus and behold His smiling face. He will put His arms around me in a warm and sweet embrace. Out of the grave His voice will call me to my home beyond the sky, There to see Him in His glory, Yes, I'll be there by and by.

### Verse 2

Jesus will take my hand and show me through that mansion I will own. He'll present me to the Father there before His mighty throne. Then I'll join that mighty chorus singing praises o'er and o'er. I will be at home forever on that peaceful golden shore.

### Verse 3

Sinner, Oh won't you love and trust Him, and believe His promise true? He will give to you a mansion in His realm beyond the blue. While you are waiting for His beckon, you can walk in peace and love, Trusting fully in His promise that you'll be with Him above.

### Chorus

I have heard the sweet love story; I have heard the gospel call. I have turned from my undoing from the sins that made me fall. I have made the true confession; I have crossed that middle wall. I've been baptized in His blood, now I wait for heaven's call.
