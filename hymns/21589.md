### Verse 1

Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him. No one else can satisfy. I should come to Him. Jesus said if I am weak, I should come to Him. No one else can be my strength. I should come to Him.
Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him. No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him



 






### Verse 2

Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him. No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him. For the Lord is good and faithful. He will keep us day and night. We can always run to Jesus. Jesus, strong and kind.

### Verse 3

Jesus said if I am lost, He will come to me. And He showed me on that cross, He will come to me. For the Lord is good and faithful. He will keep us day and night. We can always run to Jesus. Jesus, strong and kind. Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him. No one else can satisfy. I should come to Him.
