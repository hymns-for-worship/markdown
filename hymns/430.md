### Verse 1

Take the name of Jesus with you, Child of sorrow and of woe; It will joy and comfort give you, Take it then, where'er you go.

### Verse 2

 Take the name of Jesus ever As a shield from ev'ry snare; If temptations round you gather, Breathe that holy name in prayer.

### Verse 3

 O the precious name of Jesus! How it thrills our souls with joy, When His loving arms receive us, And His songs our tongues employ!

Precious name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of heav'n; Precious name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.
