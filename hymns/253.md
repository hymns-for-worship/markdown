## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Often I'm hindered on the way, burdened so heavy I almost fall; then I hear Jesus sweetly say, "heaven will surely be worth it all."

### Verse 2

Many the trials, toils and tears, many a heartache may here appall; but the dear Lord so truly says: "heaven will surely be worth it all."

### Verse 3

Toiling and pain I will endure, till I shall hear the death angel call; Jesus has promised, and I'm sure, "heaven will surely be worth it all."

### Chorus

Heaven will surely be worth it all, worth all the sorrows that here befall; after this life with all its strife, heaven will surely be worth it all.
