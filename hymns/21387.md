## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Again the Lord of light and life Awakes the kindling ray, Unseals the eyelids of the morn, And pours increasing day. O what a night was that which wrapped The heathen world in gloom! O what a Sun which rose this day Triumphant from the tomb!

### Verse 2

This day be grateful homage paid, And loud hosannas sung; Let gladness dwell in every heart And praise on every tongue. Ten thousand diff'rent lips shall join To hail this welcome morn, Which scatters blessings from its wings To nations yet unborn.
