## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

To lead a quiet life; To mind my own affairs; To work with my own hands; To rise above life's cares; To treat my fellow man with kindness ev'ry day; To be complete in Christ; For all these things I pray.

### Verse 2

To turn away from sin; To live apart from strife; To overcome my pride; To have abundant life; To cheer an aching heart; To help the poor and weak; To bear the Spirit's fruit; These things I truly seek. 

### Verse 3

To love the Lord, my God with heart and soul and mind; To share His holy Word with ev'ry soul I find; To answer for my faith to all who may inquire; To know the love of Christ; To these things I aspire.
