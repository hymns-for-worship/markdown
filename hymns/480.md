## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 We are bound for Canaan land, Tenting by the way, Who shall lead us on the road? Choose your King today. 

### Verse 2

 When the dark Red Sea of doubt Billowed in our way, Then He parted ev'ry wave So He will today.

### Verse 3

 Just before us Jordan rolls, Just across the way, We can safely trust the Lord; He shall lead today

### Chorus

Dare to stand like Joshua, Dare to say the word, As for me and for my house, We will serve the Lord.
