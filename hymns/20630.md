## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I come to Thee with outstretched arms and open heart; Lord, hear my plea. Give me the strength I need to start a life anew, a child of God where I will be a servant who with all the saints will worship Thee.

### Verse 2

I do believe that Jesus is the Son of God And surely know His virgin birth of long ago. I will declare the Bible tells His holy plan I know in there salvation is for ev'ry man.

### Verse 3

I do believe God gave His one and only son To die upon the cruel cross for ev'ryone. I testify that Jesus rose up from the grave I can't deny He did it all  my soul to save.

### Verse 4

I humbly bow repenting of my sins today; Forgive me now, O Lord, please wash them all away. My life I give to always serve and worship You, Help me to live that others will obey You, too.
