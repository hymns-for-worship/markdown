## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a home above, in the land of love, That I hope to reach some day; If in Christ we trust, He is faithful, just, And will keep us wll the way.

### Verse 2

There's a home of light, with its glory bright, Thru the eyes of faith I view; Soon may come the time, when that sunny clime Shall be ours thru grace so true.

### Verse 3

I am going there, all its gladness share With the Savior I adore; Oh! what joy 'twill be, when His fact I see, And the loved ones gone before!

### Chorus

There's a home bright and fair, Fashioned by the hand divine; When is passed earthly care, may an entrance there be mine.
