## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Each life is but a vapor, quickly vanishing to silence. Soon time will cease, this age will end, the age to come will be.

### Verse 2

As moments move into the past, and faith and hope have ended; But love learned from His sacrifice, from age to age will be.

### Verse 3

Our Lord will gather us to Him: we'll see Him in His glory. We'll change to ever be like Him, a body that will be.

### Verse 4

And thus, we'll ever live with Him, our Sun of light and loving. Such grace He gave to bring us home, how could this ever be?

### Chorus

Our Father, You lift us up to a holy path of joy and righteousness, That we might in You be found in Your presence, eternally.
