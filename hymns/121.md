## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

They tried my Lord and Master, with no one to defend, within the halls of Pilot He stood without a friend.

### Verse 2

The world may turn against Him, I'll love Him to the end, and while on earth I'm living, My Lord shall have a friend.

### Verse 3

I'll do what He may bid me, I'll go where He may send; I'll try each flying moment to prove that I'm His friend.

### Verse 4

To all who need a Savior, my friend I recommend, because He brot salvation, is why I am His friend.

### Chorus

I'll be a friend to Jesus, my life for Him I'll spend; I'll be a friend to Jesus, until my years shall end.
