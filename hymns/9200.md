My times are in Thy hand; My God, I wish them there. My life, my friends, my soul, I leave entirely to Thy care.

### Verse 2

My times are in Thy hand, Whatever they may be, if pleasing, painful, dark or bright, As best may seem to Thee.

### Verse 3

My times are in Thy hand, Why should I doubt or fear? My Father's hand will never cause His child a needless tear.
