## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ, Thou alone art my Lord, and no other Shall, on the throne of my heart, rival Thee; Stronger Thy love than the love of a mother, Deeper Thy peace than the depths of the sea.



### Verse 2

Christ, Thou alone dost from bondage deliver, Bringing me freedom and blessed release; Crushing the heart then restoring forever, Pouring into it the balm of Thy peace.



### Verse 3

Christ, Thou alone shalt be master and owner: Thou art the bridegroom and we are the bride; Faithful to Thee, to obey and to honor, Robed as a queen we shall reign at Thy side.


### Verse 4

Christ, Thou alone into harbor shall guide me, After the journey forever is o'er; Safe in Thy glory, no shadow to hide Thee, Sorrow and sighing shall end evermore.
