### Verse 1

 Whate'er you do in word or deed, Do all in the name of the Lord; Do naught in name of man or creed,

 Be not deceived by worldly greed, Do all in the name of the Lord; The Spirit says, "In word or deed," Do all in the name of the Lord.

 Till toils and labors here are done, Do all in the name of the Lord; Dear Christian friends, if you'd be one,

Do all in His name, Do all in the name of the Lord; In word or deed, as God de-creed, Do all in the name of the Lord.
