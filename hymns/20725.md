## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As Jesus stood in heaven, And looking down to see; A soul in sin and sorrow, And that someone was me. How helpless was that someone, Yet longing to be free; To be, himself, free of evil; O Lord, that someone was me. O Lord, that someone was me.

### Verse 2

He laid aside His glory, And died upon a tree; To free someone from darkness, And that someone was me. Tho' seems the pathway so lonely, My lot I place with Thee; The One who died for that someone; My Jesus knows it was me. My Jesus knows it was me.
