## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'll comfort and keep thee when sorrows o'erwhelm. A glorious sweet promise to all who'll hear and obey Me and love naught but truth and I'll hear and I'll answer your call. A promise to you and to those that have gone and to all who shall walk in My way. Your grief I'll share and each burden I'll bear and I'll know thee at ending of day

### Verse 2

I'll shelter thee safe from the shadows of dread. You'll praise Me and tell of My love, you'll hold Me exalted and higher by far than all greatness below and above. You'll fold with My sheep; and My statues you'll keep, contentment, you'll teach those who'd roam, Believe in My grace and I'll ne'er hide My face and I'll call thee: I'll beckon thee home.
