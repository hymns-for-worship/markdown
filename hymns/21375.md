## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed Jesus, at Your word We are gathered all to hear You; Let our hearts and souls be stirred Now to seek and love and fear You, By Your teachings sweet and holy, Drawn from earth to love You solely.

### Verse 2

All our knowledge, sense and sight Lie in deepest darkness shrouded, Till You come into our night With the beams of truth unclouded. You alone to God can win us; You must work all good within us.

### Verse 3

Glorious Lord, Yourself impart! Light of light, from God proceeding, Open every ear and heart; Help us by Your Spirit's pleading; Hear the cry each servant raises; Hear and bless our prayers and praises.
