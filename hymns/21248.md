## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The chimes of time ring out the news; Another day is thru. Someone slipped and fell. Was that someone you? You may have longed for added strength, your courage to renew. Do not be disheartened, for I bring hope to you.

### Verse 2

There is no night, for in His light You'll never walk alone: Always feel at home whereever you may roam. There is no pow'r can conquer you, while God is on your side. Just take Him at His promise; Don't run away and hide.

### Chorus

It is no secret what God can do. What He's done for others, He'll do for you. With arms wide open, He'll pardon you, It is no secret what God can do.
