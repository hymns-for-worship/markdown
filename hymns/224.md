## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As I journey here mid the toils and tears, there's a rainbow in the cloud; he will safely lead, I must have no fear, there's a rainbow in the cloud.

### Verse 2

After stormy rain, fields of golden grain, there's a rainbow in the cloud; winter's cold and pain, summer's harvest grain, there's a rainbow in the cloud.

### Verse 3

When the storms all pass comes a brighter day; there's a rainbow in the cloud; in that city fair, there's a crown to wear; there's a rainbow in the cloud.

### Chorus

There's a rainbow that is shining, there's a rainbow in the cloud; when life's race is run and the victory's won, there's a rainbow in the clouds.
