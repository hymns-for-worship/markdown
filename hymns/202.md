## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beyond this land of parting losing and leaving, far beyond the losses darkening this, and far beyond the taking and the bereaving, lies a summerland of bliss.

### Verse 2

Beyond this land of toiling, sowing and reaping, far beyond the shadows darkening this, and far beyond the sighing, moaning and weeping, lies a summerland of bliss.

### Verse 3

Beyond this land of waiting, seeking and sighing, far beyond the sorrows, darkening this, and far beyond the pain and sickness and dying, lies a summerland of bliss.

### Chorus

Land beyond, so fair and bright! Land beyond, where is no night! Summerland, God is its light, o happy summerland of bliss.
