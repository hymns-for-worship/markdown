## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Stay with us, O risen Jesus; Go no farther than this place; We are gathered at Your table, Bless our feasting with Your grace.

### Verse 2

Though we walk with You unseeing, Thru the labors of the week, On this day of resurrection, Be revealed to us, and speak.

### Verse 3

By this bread and cup, instruct us In the life You sacrificed; Tell the suff'rings and the glories That together name You Christ.

### Verse 4

Teach our hearts to burn within us As we hear all You have said; Thus, Lord may we recognize You In the breaking of the bread.
