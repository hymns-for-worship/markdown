## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Boast not, O death, against my soul, Tho' thou has sway from pole to pole; A mighty One shall foil thy pow'r. Lord, stand by me in that dread hour!

### Verse 2

Tho' mighty tempest rack this frame, And night be filled with grief and pain; A brighter day awaits my soul; Death's dusty grave is not my goal!

### Verse 3

Once dreadful death assailed my Lord; His spirit he did hold in ward, But Christ burst forth on that first day; On Him pale death could not hold sway!

### Verse 4

When from this tent my life is gone, E'en tho' death claims me for his own, I shall forevermore be free; My Savior will deliver me!
