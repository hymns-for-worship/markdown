## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the cross of Christ I glory, towering the wrecks of time; all the round of sacred story gathers round its head sublime.

### Verse 2

When the woes of life o'er take me, hopes decieve and fears annoy, never shall the cross forsake me; lo! It glows with peace and joy.

### Verse 3

When the sun of bliss is beaming light and love upon my way; from the cross of radiance streaming adds new luster to the day.

### Verse 4

Bain and blessing, pain and pleasure, by the cross are sanctified; peace is there that knows no measure, joys that thru all time abide.
