## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Peter was a special friend of Jesus. He followed Jesus ev'rywhere He went. He saw Him feed the hungry crowd. He saw Him raise the widow's child. He saw Him walk on water and he saw Him calm the storm.

### Verse 2

Peter was a special friend of Jesus. He knew that Jesus was the Son of God. He taught the people how to live so Jesus would their sins forgive, if they would just obey His word then they could live with Him.
