## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Comfort, comfort ye My people, Speak ye peace, thus saith our God; Comfort those who sit in darkness, Mourning 'neath their sorrows' load. Speak ye to Jerusalem Of the peace that waits for them; Tell her that her sins I cover, And her warfare now is over.



### Verse 2

Hark, the voice of one that crieth In the desert far and near, Bidding all men to repentance Since the kingdom now is here. O that warning cry obey! Now prepare for God a way; Let the valleys rise to meet Him, And the hills bow down to greet Him.



### Verse 3

Make ye straight what long was crooked, Make the rougher places plain; Let your hearts be true and humble, As befits His holy reign. For the glory of the Lord Now o'er earth is she abroad; And all flesh shall see the token That His word is never broken.
