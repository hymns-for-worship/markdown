## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out, The cry "To arms" is heard afar and near; The Lord of host is marching on to victory, The triumph of the right will soon appear.

### Verse 2

Â The fight is on, arouse, ye soldiers brave and true, Jehovah leads, and vict'ry  will assure; Go buckle on the armor God has given you, And in His strength unto the end endure.

### Verse 3

The Lord is leading on to certain victory, The bow of promise spans the eastern sky; His glorious name in ev'ry land shall honored be, The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.

### Chorus

The fight is on, O Christian soldier, And face to face in stern array, With armor gleaming and colors streaming, The right and wrong engaged today; The fight is on, but be not weary, Be strong and in His might hold fast; If God be for us, His banner o'er us, We'll sing the victor's song at last.
