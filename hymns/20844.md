## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am coming to the cross; I am poor and weak and blind; Tho' I count my soul but lost: I shall full salvation find.

### Verse 2

Long my heart has sighed for Thee; Long has evil reigned within; Jesus sweetly speaks to me, "I will cleanse you from all sin."

### Verse 3

Here I give my all to Thee; Friends and time and earthly store; Soul and body Thine to be, Wholly Thine forever more.

### Chorus

I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, Blessed Lamb of Calvary; Humbly at Thy cross I bow, Save me, Jesus, save me now.

### Verse 4

I am coming to the cross; I am poor and weak and blind; Tho' I count my soul but lost: I shall full salvation find.
