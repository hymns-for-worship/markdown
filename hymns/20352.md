# 20352 - CROSSING THE BAR

## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home, turns home.

### Verse 2

Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell When I, when I embark; For, tho' from out our bourne of time and place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar.
