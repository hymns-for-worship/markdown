## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the Christian's home in glory, There remains a land of rest; There my Savior's gone before me To fulfill my soul's request.

### Verse 2

He is fitting up my mansion, Which eternally shall stand, For my stay shall not be transient In that holy, happy land.

### Verse 3

Pain and sickness ne'er shall enter, Grief nor woe my lot shall share, But, in that celestial center, I a crown of life shall wear.

### Verse 4

Sing, O, sing, ye heirs of glory, Shout your triumphs as ye go; Zion's gates will open for you, Ye shall find an entrance through.

### Chorus

There is rest for the weary, There is rest for the weary, There is rest for the weary, There is rest for you. On the other side of Jordan, In the sweet fields of Eden, Where the tree of life is blooming, There is rest for you.
