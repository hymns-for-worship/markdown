### Verse 1

We walk in fear upon the earth, Redeemed with gold nor silver But with the precious blood of Christ, Thru whom we are believers.

### Verse 2

A royal priesthood, chosen race, We are Your holy nation, No longer strangers in Your sight But heirs of Your salvation.

We come to You as living stones, Built up and fit together. Come fill Your holy house, O God; Abide within for ever. The Holy One has called us, Be holy, for I am holy.
