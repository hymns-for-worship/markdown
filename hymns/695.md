### Verse 1

 Savior, grant me rest and peace, Let my troubled dreamings cease; With the chiming midnight bell, Teach my heart that "all is well." 

### Verse 2

 I would trust my all with Thee, All my cares and sorrows flee, Till the breaking light shall tell Night is past, and "all is well."

### Verse 3

 I would seek Thy service, Lord, Leaning on Thy promiseword; Let my hourly labors tell I am Thine, and "all is well." Amen.
