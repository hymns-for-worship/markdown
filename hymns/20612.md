## Notation

F - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Oft when the twilight gathers around me, Clear, in the shadows, faces I see; Deep in the stillness voices are calling, Loved ones are calling, calling for me.

### Verse 2

Friends of the past, whom often I've greeted, Here as they journeyed, even as I; Lovingly wait and watch for my coming, With them to share the glories on high.

### Verse 3

Many are gone, who here were my kindred, To the abode of spirits made free; They, with  my Lord and all His redeemed ones, Longingly wait and beckon for me.

### Chorus

Sweetly they're calling, lovingly calling, Those whom I loved, so happy and free; Out from the shining portals of glory, Loved ones are calling, calling for me.
