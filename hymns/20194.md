## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beautiful Lamb of God, guiltless and pure as snow, Gentle and merciful, beautiful Lamb of God.  Sent from the Father's love, Sent from the throne above, Sent to redeem us with His blood.

### Verse 2

Beautiful Lamb of God, guiltless and pure as snow, Gentle and merciful, beautiful Lamb of God.  Behold the Lamb of God Suff'ring great pain for us, And by His wounds we all are healed.

### Verse 3

Beautiful Lamb of God, guiltless and pure as snow, Gentle and merciful, beautiful Lamb of God.  Like sheep we've gone asrat, Each turn to his own way, But Jesus will take our sins away.
