## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Immortal Love, forever full, Forever flowing free, Forever shared, forever whole, A neverebbing sea!



### Verse 2

We may not climb the heav'nly steeps To bring the Lord Christ down; In vain we search the lowest deeps, For Him no depths can drown.


### Verse 3

But warm, sweet tender, even yet A present help is He; And faith has still its Olivet, And love its Galilee.


### Verse 4

The healing of His seamless dress Is by our beds of pain: We touch Him in life's throng and press, And we are whole again.

### Verse 5

Thru Him the first fond prayers are said Our lips of childhood frame; The last low whispers of our dead Are burdened with His name.
