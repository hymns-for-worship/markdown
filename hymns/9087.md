## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He was here, Our Lord did come, the proof is ev'rywhere. He was here. And ev'ryone is telling how He cared. They say His name, His love proclaim, somehow they know He reigns. For tho' we do not see Him, He was here.

### Verse 2

He was here. The stories live of how He loves and cares. He was here. His word is taught and people know and fear. To Him they pray, they teach His way, they know He'll come some day. For tho' we do not feel Him, He was here.

### Verse 3

He was here. The saints are ready for their cross they'll bear. He was here. And saints are unashamed His name to wear. For Him they'll die, they know just why, for He was crucified. For tho' we do not hear Him, He was here.

### Chorus

He was here. His evidence is clear. He is near. In joy we shed a tear. He was here. His love will make aware He was here, and He is here.
