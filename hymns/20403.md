## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ, our one true salvation, known before the world. Savior of all nations, tho't before our birth.

### Verse 2

Christ was born in Bethlehem, of the virgin Mary. Promise made to Abraham, now fulfilled with glory.

### Verse 3

Christ, the Perfect Son of God, walked among the sinners. Preached the work to save the lost, mocked by disblievers.

### Verse 4

Christ was crucified for me, died for those that hate Him. Rose from death for all to see, carried into Heaven.
