## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end; be Thou forever near me, my Master and my friend: I shall not fear the battle if Thou art by my side, nor wander from the pathway if Thou wilt be my guide.

### Verse 2

O let me feel Thee near me: the world is ever near; I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear; my foes are ever near me, around me and within; but, Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.

### Verse 3

O Jesus, Thou hast promised to all who follow Thee, that where Thou art in glory there shall Thy servant be; and Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end: o give me grace to follow my Master and my friend.
