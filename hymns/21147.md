## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is an unseen hand to me That leads thru ways I cannot see; While going thru this world of woe, This hand still leads where're I go. 

### Verse 2

His hand has lead thru shadows drear, And while it leads I have no fear; I know 'twill lead me to that home Where sin nor sorrow e're can come.

### Verse 3

I long to see my Savior's face and sing the story Saved by grace; And there upon that golden strand I'll praise Him for His guiding hand.

### Chorus

I'm holding to the unseen hand That guides me thru this dreary land; And some sweet day I'll reach that strand, Still holding to the unseen hand. 

### Coda

And some sweet day I'll reach that strand, Still holding to the unseen hand.
