## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O grant us light, that we may know The wisdom Thou alone canst give; That truth may guide wheree'er we go, And virtue bless wheree'er we live.



### Verse 2

O grant us light, that we may see Where error lurks in human lore, And turn our doubting minds to Thee, And love Thy simple Word the more.



### Verse 3

O grant us light, that we may learn How dead is life from Thee apart, How sure is joy for all who turn To Thee an undivided heart. 


### Coda

Amen.
