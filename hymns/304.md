## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Why do you wait dear brother, o why do you tarry so long? Your savior is waiting to give you a place in his sanctified throng.

### Verse 2

What do you hope dear brother to gain by a further delay? There's no one to save you but Jesus, there's no other way but His way.

### Verse 3

Why do you wait dear brother? The harvest is passing away; your savior is longing to bless you there's danger and death in delay.

### Chorus

Why not? Why not? Why not come to him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to him now?
