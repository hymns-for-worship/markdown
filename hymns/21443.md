## Notation

G - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nothing between my soul and the Savior, Naught of this world's delusive dream; I have renounced all sinful pleasure, Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

### Verse 2

Nothing between like worldly pleasure; Habits of life, tho' harmless they seem; Must not my heart from Him ever sever, He is my all, there's nothing between.

### Verse 3

Nothing between like pride or station; Self or friends shall not intervene; Tho' it may cost me much tribulation, I am resolved, there's nothing between.

### Verse 4

Nothing between e'en many hard trials, Tho' the whole world against me convene; Watching with pray'r and much self denial, I'll triumph at last, there's nothing between.

### Chorus

Nothing between my soul and the Savior, So that His blessed face may be seen; Nothing preventing the least of His favor, Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
