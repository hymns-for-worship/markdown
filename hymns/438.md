# 438 - We Walk By Faith

## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We look at things we cannot see, Eternal things above, Where Christ our Savior ever lives And intercedes in love.

### Verse 2

Our love is on the things above And not on things below; When Christ who is our life appears, His glory we shall know.

### Verse 3

 Heav'n is a glorious place prepared  By God the Father's Son; We hope to see Him face to face And hear the words "well done." 

### Chorus

We walk by faith and not by sight, Our hearts are filled with love; In hope we wait for Christ's return To take us home above.
