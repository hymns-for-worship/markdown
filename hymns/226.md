# 226 - Beyond The Sunset's Radiant Glow

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beyond the sunset's radiant glow there is a brighter world, where golden glories ever shine, beyond the thot of days decline.

### Verse 2

Beyond the sunset's purple rim, beyond the twilight, deep and dim, where clouds and darkness never come, my soul shall find its heavenly home.

### Verse 3

Beyond this desert, dark and drear, the golden city will appear; and morning's lovely beams arise upon my mansion in the skies.

### Chorus

Beyond the sunset's radiant glow; there is a brighter world, I know; beyond the sunset I may spend delightful days that never end.
