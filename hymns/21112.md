## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted; Not I, but Christ, be seen be known, be heard; Not I, but Christ, in every look and action, Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word.

### Verse 2

Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow; Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;
Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden! Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.


### Verse 3

Christ, only Christ! No idle words e’er falling, Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound; 
Christ, only Christ; no self-important bearing; Christ, only Christ; no trace of “I” be found.



### Verse 4

Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying; Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be,
Not I, but Christ, for body, soul, and spirit, Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.


### Verse 5

Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision; Glory excelling, soon, full soon, I'll see
Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling Christ, only Christ, my All in all to be.
