## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We have not because we ask not or because we ask selfishly. When we seek the heart of God who giveth freely, we will ask; He will give, ev'rything we need.

### Verse 2

Ask and it will be giv'n. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you. For our God giveth freely ev'rything we need.

### Verse 3

If any of you lacks wisdom then ask our God who gives freely with no reproach, But let him ask in faith with no doubting, For our God freely gives all we need.

### Verse 4

Don't be anxious for God knows what we need before we ask. Ask in faith for God gives all that we need.
