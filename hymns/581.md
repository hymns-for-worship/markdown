## Notation

Ab - 3/2 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O for a faith that will not shrink, Tho' pressed by ev'ry foe, That will not tremble on the brink Of any earthly woe.

### Verse 2

 A faith that shines more bright and clear When tempests rage without; That when in danger knows no fear, In darkness feels no doubt.

### Verse 3

 Lord, give us such a faith as this; And then, whate'er may come, We'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss Of an eternal home.
