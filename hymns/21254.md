## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have you failed in your plan of your stormtossed life? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand; Are you weary and worn from its toil and strife? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand.

### Verse 2

Are you walking alone thru the shadows dim? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand; Christ will comfort your heart, put your trust in Him, Place your hand in the nailscarred hand.

### Verse 3

Would you follow the will of the risen Lord? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand; Would you live in the light of His blessed Word? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand.

### Verse 4

Is your soul burdened down with its load of sin? Place your hand in the nailscarred hand; Throw your heart open wide, let the Savior in, Place your hand in the nailscarred hand.

### Chorus

Place your hand in the nailscarred hand, Place your hand in the nailscarred hand; He will keep to the end, He's your dearest friend, Place your hand in the nailscarred hand.
