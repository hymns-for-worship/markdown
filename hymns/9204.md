## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, keep me all the way. Hold my hand. Stay by me all the day. Hold my hand. When storms of life their thund'rous roars unleash, Show me that Thou are near. Stay by me, Hold my hand. 

### Verse 2

Keep me from all harm's way. Hold my hand. Watch o'er me lest I stray. Hold my hand. Teach me Thy wondrous love and tenderness. Help me to walk with Thee. I need Thee, Hold my hand.

### Verse 3

When dark my way, and drear, Hold my hand. Keep me from doubt and fear. Hold my hand. When wrong seems right and my heart can't undestand, Stay by me, keep me, Lord. Oh! Help me, Hold my hand. Amen.
