### Verse 1

 "Take up your cross," the Savior said, "If you would my disciple be; Take up your cross with willing heart, And humbly follow after me."

### Verse 2

 Take up your cross, nor heed heed the shame, And let your foolish pride be still;Your Lord refused not e'en to die Upon a cross on Calv'ry's hill.

### Verse 3

 Take up your cross, then, in His strength, And calmly ev'ry danger brave; 'Twill guide you to a better home, And lead to vict'ry o'er the grave.

### Verse 4

 Take up your cross, and follow Christ, Nor think till death to lay it down; For only he who bears the cross May hope to wear the glor'ous crown.
