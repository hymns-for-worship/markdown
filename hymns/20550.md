## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

May my life be like a prayer, Like a fond petition to the Father fair. May it rise to heaven, fragrant sweet. May I lay it humbly at the Master's feet. May I live my life confessing, Him all heaven doth declare. May my life be like a blessing. May my life be like a prayer.

### Verse 2

May my life be like a light, Piercing through the darkness, like a beacon bright. May it rise to heaven, vision sweet. May I lay it humbly at the Pilot's feet. May I live my life confessing, Him who driveth out the night. May my life be like a blessing. May my life be like a light.

### Verse 3

May my life be like a song, Melody of angels, clear and true and strong. May it rise to heaven, anthem sweet. May I lay it humbly at the Savior's feet. May I live my life confessing, Him all glory doth belong. May my life be like a blessing. May my life be like a song.
