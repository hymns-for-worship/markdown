## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Again within the house of pray'r My sacrifice I bring; My swelling heart is filled with joy, And I can loudly sing.

### Verse 2

The love of Christ within my soul All fear has driven out; And as I feel His presence there I cannot help but shout.

### Verse 3

My soul today is mounting up, Like birds upon the wing; I'm living now in liberty, And that is why I sing.

### Verse 4

No doubt or care their fetters dark Upon my soul shall place; In freedom I will ever walk Before my Savior's face.

### Chorus

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I'm free, yes, I'm free! Thru the cleansing blood of Jesus I'm free, yes, I'm free.
