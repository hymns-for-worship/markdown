### Verse 1

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, there's a place that is wondrously fair; for it glows with the light of His presence: tis the beautiful garden of prayer.

### Verse 2

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, and I go with my burden and care, just to learn from His lips words of comfort, in the beautiful garden of prayer.

### Verse 3

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, and He bids you come meet with Him there, just to bow and receive a new blessing, in the beautiful garden of prayer.

### Chorus

O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer, o the beautiful garden of prayer; there my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates to the beautiful garden of prayer.
