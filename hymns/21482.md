## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O for a heart to praise my God, A heart from sin set free, A heart that always feels the blood So freely shed for me. A heart resigned, submissive, meek, My great Redeemer's throne. Where only Christ is heard to speak, Where Jesus reigns alone.


### Verse 2

A heart in every tho't renewed, And full of love divine, Complete and right and pure and good, A copy, Lord, of Thine. Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart; Come quickly from above; Write Thy new name upon my heart, Thy new, best name of Love.
