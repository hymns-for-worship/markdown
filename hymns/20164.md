## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Lord, I need nothing beside You; Without You, I could not have stood. Your promise is my hope, and my refuge; Your nearness my strength and my good.

### Verse 2

When I was distressed and embittered by things I could not understand, Your presence was continu'lly with me, You always took hold of my hand.

### Verse 3

I know that Your counsel will guide me in wisdom, devotion, and love, And afterward You'll call me to glory to dwell in Your presence above.

### Chorus

My heart may be broken within me; My earthly strength may depart. But You are my portion forever, You are the Rock of my heart. You are the Rock of my heart.
