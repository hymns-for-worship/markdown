# 1151 - To Live Is Christ

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Life has no promises for health or fame, There's no assurances for earthly gain, Now Christ our Savior lives within our heart, Heaven, the promised home, shall ne'er depart.

### Verse 2

Our hearts are sad, forlorn, loved ones are gone, Deep in our souls we cry, we're so alone, Christ knows our heartaches here, and yes, He cares, On earth He walked as man, our burdens shares.

### Verse 3

Christ made the sacrifice our souls to save, He died on Calvary, His love He gave, Rejoice ye in the Lord, praise His great name, For us to live is Christ, to die is gain.
