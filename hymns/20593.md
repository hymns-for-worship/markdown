## Lyrics

### Verse 1

At times, my Lord, I fall and scorn Your gentle reign; I hope to plot a better course, my own through joy and pain. But in the loss of hope that naught of mine restores, I bring my life to You again; The kingdom, Lord, is Yours.

### Verse 2

At times, when I succeed, I then forget Your might; I trust the strength that I possess in doing what is right. But when my strength is weak, Your strength alone endures; I move by Your sufficient grace; The power, Lord, is Yours.

### Verse 3

At times my heedless pride will drive me to obey; I think to glorify myself by doing what You say. But when I see Your light, which only sin obscures, I know the dimness of my own; The glory, Lord, is Yours.
