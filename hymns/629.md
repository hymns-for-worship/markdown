# 629 - Heaven, The Place I Long To Be

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 If heaven's a place where there'll be no pain, No sorrow nor crying ever again; Where saints and angels sing refrain; Then that's the place I long to be.

### Verse 2

 If heaven's a place with its street of gold, Where saved ones shall walk and never grow old; There safe from harm in the Shepherd's fold; Then that's the place I long to be.

### Verse 3

 If heaven's a place with its beauty rare, With pleasures and joys beyond all compare; Eternal life with the Father there; Then that's the place I long to be.

### Verse 4

 But most of all it's my Lord to see, Who shed His life's blood to set my soul free; O heaven means so much to me; Yes, that's the place  I  long to be.
