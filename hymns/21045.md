## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It's amazing and incredible, But it's true as it can be, God still loves and understands us all, And that means you and me.

### Verse 2

O His grace is all sufficient now; For the young and for the old, For the lonely and the timid soul, The brash and for the bold.

### Verse 3

God's great love has no exceptions here; So don't ever feel alone, And no matter who or what you are, He claims you for His own.

### Verse 4

Yes, whatever your old past has been, Trust in God He understands, Cast your burdens on the Lord above, Just place them in His hands.

### Chorus

For in all of our unloveliness, God the Father loves us still. He has loved us since the world began, And what more He always will.
