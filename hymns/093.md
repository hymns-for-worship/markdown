## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My God and I go in the field together, we walk and talk as good friends should and do; we clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter, my God and I walk through the meadow's hue; we clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter, my God and I walk through the meadows hue.

### Verse 2

He tells me of the years that went before me, when heav'nly plans were made for me to be, whn all was but a dream of dim conception, to come to life, earth's verdant glory see; when all was but a dream of dim conception, to come to life, earth's verdant glory see.

### Verse 3

My God and I will go for aye together, we'll walk ad talk as good friends should and do; this earth will pass, and with it common trifles, but God and I will go unendingly; this earth will pass, and with it common trifles, but God and I will go unendingly.
