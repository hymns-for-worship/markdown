How shall the young secure their hearts, And guard their lives from sin? Thy word the choicest rules im-parts To keep the conscience clean, To keep the conscience clean.

Tis like the sun, a heav'nly light, That guides us all the day; And, thru the dangers of the night, A lamp to lead our way, A lamp to lead our way.
