## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Fear not, little flock says  the Savior divine, The Father has willed that the kingdom be thine; O soil not your garments with sin here below, My sheep  and my lambs must be whiter than snow. 

### Verse 2

 Far whiter than snow, and as fair as the day, For Christ is the fountain to wash guilt away; O give Him, poor sinner, that burden of thine, And enter the fold of the ninety and nine.

### Verse 3

 Ride over temptation and cease your alarms, Your Shepherd is Jesus, your refuge His arms; He'll never forsake you, a Brother and Friend, But love you and save you in worlds without end. 

### Chorus

Whiter than snow, Whiter than the snow. ( I long to be dear Savior,) Whiter than the snow, Whiter than snow.
