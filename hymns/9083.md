## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord is my Shepherd, My needs are at hand, Contented with Him I abide. I drink from His brook and I rest in His shade, my blessings He'll richly provide. And in the dark valley 'mong shadows of dread, For danger I need not despair, With rod and with scepter He'll see me safe thru, And glory is waiting me there. And glory is waiting me there.

### Verse 2

My soul He restoreth, He claims me His own, And surely my cup overflows. He makes me lie down with His own in His fold, With might He opposeth my foes. Confronted with mercy and goodness I'll be, With those in the house of the Lord, I know there's a mansion now waiting for me, And great is my final reward. And great is my final reward.
