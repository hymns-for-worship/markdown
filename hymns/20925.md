### Verse 1

Bless Thou the gifts our hands have bro't; Bless Thou the work our hearts have planned; Ours is the faith, the will, the tho't; The rest, O God, is in Thy hand.

### Verse 2

Thine is the bounty of each day, And Thine, when we return it, still, So we can only give and pray That it should work as Thou dost will.

### Verse 3

And when we sow Thy Word, we know It is Thy harvest we shall see; We plant Thy seeds and help them grow, But all the increase comes from Thee.
