## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I stand, I stand to praise You, But I fall, I fall to my knees; My spirit now  is willing, But my flesh is so weak.

### Verse 2

I feel Your arms around me, As the pow'r of Your healing begins; Your Spirit moves right thro' me, Like a mighty, rushing wind.

### Chorus

Light the fire in my soul; Fan the flame, make me whole. Lord, You know where I've been; So light the fire in my heart again.
