## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am longing for the coming of the snowwhite angel band, That shall bear my weary spirit To the sinless summerland; As I tread the narrow pathway, Thru this thorny vale I dream, Of the joys that ever brighten Where the pearly waters gleam. 

### Verse 2

I am waiting for the signal that shall speak my full release, And present my welcome passport To the realms of perfect peace; Yes, and when the weary sandals All the dusty way have trod, I shall sing among the angels By the golden throne of God.

### Verse 3

I am longing to be going, yet my Father's kind command Bids me tarry 'mid the shadows Of the misty, lowerland; When my pilgrimage is ended I shall stem the turbid flood, And recline upon the bosom Of the spotless Son of God.

### Chorus

I am longing for the coming Of the snowwhite angel band, That shall bear my weary spirit To that sinless summerland.
