## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ be my leader by night as by day, Safe thru the darkness, for He is the way. Gladly I follow, my future His care; Darkness is daylight when Jesus is there.

### Verse 2

Christ be my teacher in age as in youth, Drifting or doubting, for He is the truth. Grant me to trust Him; tho' shifting as sand, Doubt cannot daunt me: in Jesus I stand.

### Verse 3

Christ be my Savior in calm as in strife; Death cannot hold me, for He is the life. Nor darkness, nor doubting, nor sin and its stain Can touch my salvation: with Jesus I reign.
