## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, we heed Thy love's request, And come as souls redeemed and blest, Around Thy table Thou has spread With fruit of vine and broken bread.

### Verse 2

Thy lifeblood shed upon the cross, To cleanse our souls of sin's dark dross, Thy body pierced on Calvary, Have proved the boundless love of Thee.

### Verse 3

Here faith and hope and love grow strong, Our gratitude breaks forth in song, In mem'ry of Thy dying love, That lifts our souls to Thee above.
