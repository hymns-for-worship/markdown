## Notation

A - 12/8 on 10 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Looking to Thee from day to day, Trusting Thy grace along the way, Knowing that Thou wilt safely keep all that is Thine; Sure of Thy soul redeeming love, Sure of a crown of life above, 

### Verse 2

 Looking to Thee for all I need, Finding in Thee a Friend indeed, All of the burdens of the day meekly I bear; Neither the foe nor storm I fear, Savior divine, for Thou art near, Ready my cares and troubles all freely to share. 

### Verse 3

 After a while in heaven bright, Where there is neither sin nor night, I shall behold Thee, face to face, Jesus my own; Then with the saved ones gone before, I shall with rapture, more and more, Praise Thee forever, near the bright, beautiful throne. 

### Chorus

Looking to Thee, Trusting thy grace, I am as happy as a true soldier can be; Nearing my own heavenly place, Trusting Thy love I press along looking to Thee.
