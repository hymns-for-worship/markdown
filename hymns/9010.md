## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator, In grateful devotion or tribute we bring. We lay it before Thee, we kneel and adore Thee, We bless Thy holy name, glad praises we sing.

### Verse 2

We worship Thee, God of our fathers, we bless Thee; Thru lif's storm and tempest our Guide hast Thou been. When perils o'retake us, Thou wilt not forsake us, And with Thy help, O Lord, life's battles we win.

### Verse 3

With voices united our praises we offer, And gladly our songs of true worship we raise. Thy strong arm will guide us, our God is before us, To Thee, our great Redeemer, ever be prasie.
