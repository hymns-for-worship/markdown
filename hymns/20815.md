## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a rock in a weary land, It's shadow falls on the burning sand; Inviting pilgrims as they pass To seek a shade in the wilderness. Then why will ye die? O! Why will ye die? When the shelt'ring Rock is so near by, O! Why will ye die?

### Verse 2

There is a Well in a desert plain, It's water call with entreating strain. "Ho ev'ry thirsting, sinsick soul, Come freely drink, and drink and thou shalt be whole." Then why will ye die? O! why will ye die?  When the living Well is so near by, O! why will ye die? 

### Verse 3

A great fold stands with its portals wide, The sheep astray on the mountian side; The Shepherd climbs o'er mountians steep, He's reaching now all who His wand'ring sheep. Then why will ye die? O! why will ye die?  When the Shepherd's fold is so near by, O! why will ye die? 

### Verse 4

There is a cross where the Savior died, His blood flowed out in a crimson tide; A sacrifice for sins of men, And free to all who will enter in. Then why will ye die? O! Why will ye die? When the crimson cross is so near by. O! why will ye die?
