# 208 - Sing To Me Of Heaven

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sing to me of heaven, sing that song of peace from the toil that binds me it will bring release; burdens will be lifted that are pressing so, showers of great blessings o'er my heart will flow.

### Verse 2

Sing to me of heaven as I walk alone, dreaming of the comrade that so long has gone; in a fairer region, 'mong the angel throng, we are happy as they sing that old sweet song.

### Verse 3

Sing to me of heaven, tenderly and low, till the shadows o'er me rise and swiftly go; when my heart is weary, when the day is long, sing to me of heaven, sing that old sweet song.

### Chorus

Sing to me of heaven, let me fondly dream of its golden glory, of its pearly gleam; sing to me when shadows of the evening fall, sing to me of heaven, sweetest song of all.
