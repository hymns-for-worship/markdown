Give thanks to God, for He is good. Give thanks to God, above all gods. Give thanks to Him, the Lord of lords, For His steadfast love endures forever!

To Him whose wisdom made the sky, To Him who hung the heav'nly lights, To Him who spread the earth abroad, For His steadfast love endures forever!

To Him who bro't all Egypt low, To Him who called His firstborn forth, To Him who split the sea in two, For His steadfast love endures forever!

To Him who saw our low estate, To Him who saved us from our foes, To Him who gives the bread of life, For His steadfast love endures forever!

Let all the house of Israel say, Forever! Forever! Let all the royal priesthood say, Forever! Forever! Let all who fear the LORD proclaim: His steadfast love endures Forever!
