## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I love to tell the story Of unseen things above, Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love; I love to tell the story Because I know 'tis true; It satisfies my longings As nothing else can do. 

### Verse 2

 I love to tell the story: 'Tis pleasant to repeat What seems, each time I tell it, More wonderfully sweet; I love to tell the story, For some have never heard The message of salvation From God's own holy word. 

### Verse 3

 I love to tell the story For those who know it best Seem hungering and thirsting To hear it like the rest; And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song, 'Twill be the old, old story That I have loved so long. 

### Chorus

I love to tell the story!'Twell be my theme in glory To tell he old, old story Of Jesus and His love.
