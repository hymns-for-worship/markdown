# 346 - Shall I Crucify My Savior

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Shall I crucify my savior, when for me he bore such loss? Shall I put to shame my savior? Can I nail him to the cross?

### Verse 2

Are temptations so alluring? Do earth's pleasures so enthrall, that I cannot love my savior well enough to leave them all?

### Verse 4

O! the kindly hands of Jesus, pouring blessings on all men! Bleeding, nailscarred hands of Jesus! Can I nail them once again?

### Chorus

Shall I crucify my savior? Crucify my lord again? Once! O once I crucified him! Shall I crucify again?

### Verse 3

Twas my sins that crucified Him, Shall they crucify Him yet? Blackest day of nameless anguish, Can my thankless soul forget? day of nameless an-guish, Can my thankless soul forget?
