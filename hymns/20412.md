## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the vineyard of the Lord, There is work for all to do; Will you go and work today, with a purpose strong and true?

### Verse 2

Brother, sister, hear the call! All along, your aid afford; Let us strive to save the lost; Strive to save by work and word.

### Verse 3

Mark the spirit's direful fate, Wheresoever sin is found; Come, and lend a helping hand, Let the shackles be unbound.

### Verse 4

Oh, for workers strong and brave, Who will lift the banner high; so the lost can see the way, to the mansions in the sky.

### Chorus

Heed the call brother dear, For workers today; Let your eyes see the need Of workers today.
