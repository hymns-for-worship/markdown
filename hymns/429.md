## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I wandered in the shades of night, Till Jesus came to me, And with the sunlight of His love Bid all my darkness flee.

### Verse 2

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky, And billows round me roll, However dark the world may be, I've sunlight in my soul.

### Verse 3

While walking in the light of God, I sweet communion find; I press with holy vigor on, And leave the world behind. 

### Verse 4

Â Soon I shall see Him as He is, The light that came to me, Behold the brightness of His face, Thruout eternity.

### Chorus

Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today, Sunlight, sunlight all along the way; Since the Savior found me, took away my sin, I have had the sunlight of His love within.
