## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The LORD unto my Lord has said, "Sit here at my right hand until I make Your enemies submit to Your command. A scepter prospered by the LORD Your mighty hand shall wield; From Zion You shall rule the world, and all Your foes shall yield.

### Verse 2

"Your people will be gladly Yours when You arise in might, Like dawning day, like hopeful youth, with holy beauty bright. The priesthood of Melchizedek the LORD has given You; It shall remain forevermore; God's word is always true.

### Verse 3

"You shall subdue the kings of earth, with God at Your right hand; The nations You shall rule in might and judge in ev'ry land." The Lord, refreshed by living streams, shall neither faint nor fall, And He shall be the glorious head, exalted over all.
