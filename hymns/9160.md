## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What direction are you headed with your life? Can you see where you are going with your life? Does the Savior's compass guide you, In the storm His harbor hide you? What direction are you headed with your life?

### Verse 2

What companions are around you in your life? Do the evil ones surround you in your life? Will tomorrow find you weeping o'er the company you're keeping?

### Verse 3

Will the choices that you make enhance your life? There will be no second chance to  live your life. When the Judgment you are facing, There will be no step retracing.

### Verse 4

You are standing at the crossroads of your life. You must choose the path to take to live your life. Let there be no hesitation. Make it Heaven's destination!
