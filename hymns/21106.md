## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. O Rise up, Lord, and bring them down; Keep me as the apple of Your eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings. Rescue me from the wicked. O Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. Enemies surround me, throw me to the ground, Like a hungry lion, they have tracked me down; Show the wonder of Your love,  save me by Your hand; I have kept my heart for You, in Your path I stand. 

### Verse 2

Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. O Rise up, Lord, and bring them down; Keep me as the apple of Your eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings. Rescue me from the wicked. O Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. Listen to my crying, hear my righteous plea, For my vindication, praying You will see; Calling You to answer me, save me from my foe; Their reward is in this life, mine in Whom I know. Lord. And I will see Your face.

### Verse 3

Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. Rescue me from the wicked, O Rise up, Lord, and bring them down; Keep me as the apple of Your eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings. Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord. Rescue me from the wicked, O Lord.
