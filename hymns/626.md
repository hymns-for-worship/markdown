# 626 - It Is Well With My Soul

## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When peace like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll, Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, "It is well, it is well with my soul."

### Verse 2

 Tho' Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come, Let this blest assurance control, That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

### Verse 3

 My sin, O the bliss of this glorious tho't! My sin not in part but the whole, Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! 

### Verse 4

 And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll, The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, "Even so" it is well with my soul.

### Chorus

It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well with my soul.
