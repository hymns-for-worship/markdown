## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

No one but thee shall own my heart, No matter what it costs me. If at Thy name all friends depart, No one but Thee shall own me.

### Verse 2

Nothing but Thee shall claim my soul. Naught of earth lasts forever. What of this world can  make me whole? Nothing but Thee shall claim me.

### Verse 3

Nowhere but heav'n shall be my home, No earthly house or mansion. No walls so fair, no hearth of stone, No home for me but heaven.
