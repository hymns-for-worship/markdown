## Notation

D - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall, Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all; Harken! what meaneth the sudden call? What will you do with Jesus?

### Verse 2

Jesus is standing on trial still, You can be false to Him if you will, You can be faithful thru good or ill: What will you do with Jesus?

### Verse 3

Will you evade Him as Pilate tried? Or will you choose Him, whate'er betide? Vainly you struggle from Him to hide: What will you do with Jesus?

### Verse 4

Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny? Or will you scorn from His foes to fly, Daring for Jesus to live or die? What will you do with Jesus?

### Verse 5

"Jesus, I give Thee my heart today! Jesus, I'll follow Thee all the way, Gladly obeying Thee!" will you say: "This I will do with Jesus!"

### Chorus

What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you cannot be; Some day your heart will be asking, "What will He do with me?"
