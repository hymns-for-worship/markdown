## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God gave me eyes and ears, a nose and mouth and put them on my face. He gave me arms and legs and hands and feet and put them in their place. So I could walk and talk and run and play and do so many things. I want to jump and shout and praise His name for all the joy He brings.

### Verse 2

My God is wonderful and powerul and does so much for me. I want to tell my friends and neighbors of His love and majesty. I'll use my eyes and ears, my nose and mouth to share my God with you. And with my arms and legs and hands and feet there's so much I can do.
