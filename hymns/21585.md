## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Not what these hands have done can save this guilty soul; Not what this toiling flesh has borne can make my spirit whole. Not what I feel or do can give me peace with God; Not all my pray'rs and sighs and tears can bear my awful load.





### Verse 2

Thy work alone, O Christ, can ease this weight of sin; Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God, can give me peace within. Thy love to me, O God, not mine, O Lord, to Thee, Can rid me of this dark unrest, and set my spirit free.

### Verse 3

Thy grace alone, O God, to me can pardon speak; Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God, can this sore bondage break. I bless the Christ of God; I rest on love divine; And with unfalt'ring lip and heart, I call this Savior mine.

### Verse 4

I praise the God of grace; I trust His truth and might; He calls me His, I call Him mine, my God, my joy, my light. 'Tis He who saveth me, and freely pardon gives; I love because He loveth me,
I live because He lives
