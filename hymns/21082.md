## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Call unto Me and I will surely hear thee; Yes, I will hear thy plea where'er My lambs may be. In far off vales of sin or near beneath my wing; I hold thy prayers to Me, My child, a sacred thing. 

### Verse 2

Thus saith my Lord, "Come unto me in meek-ness." And I will bless thy day no matter come what may. I'll make thy grief all gone and brush thy tears away; I'll walk with thee and never leave thee all alone.

### Verse 3

Call unto Me and say "My Lord, forgive me," And I will touch thy soul with peace and graces all. And I will know thy voice, tho' soft and weak with pain; and it shall touch my ear for I will hear thee call.
