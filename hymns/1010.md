## Notation

C - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have seen You walk down a dusty road, I have watched You stumble from my heavy load; In my heart I struggled, but I always knew the Holy Redeemer from heaven was You.

### Verse 2

I have seen You heal the lame, the blind, I have watched Your goodness, so pure, so kind; In my heart I crumbled when I watched You die, But now I rejoice for I know You're alive.

### Chorus

My eyes have seen Your glory, My hands have touched Your face, My heart still burns within my breast from the warmth of Your embrace. My eyes have seen Your glory, My life forever changed; and when this journey comes to an end, I'll rest in Your endless grace.
