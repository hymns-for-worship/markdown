## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We saw thee not when thou didst come to this poor world of sin and death; nor yet beheld that cottage home in that despised nazareth; but we believe thy footsteps trod its streets and plains, thou Son of God: but we believe thy footsteps trod its streets and plains, thou son of God.

### Verse 2

We saw thee not when lifted high amid that wild and savage crew; nor heard we that imploring cry, "forgive, they know not what they do!" but we believe the deed was done that shook the earth and veiled the sun; but we believe the deed was done that shook the earth and veiled the sun.

### Verse 3

We gazed not in the open tomb where once thy mangled body lay; nor saw thee in the upper room, nor met thee on the open way; but we believe that angels said, "why seek the living with the dead?" but we believe that angels said, "why seek the living with the dead?"

### Verse 4

We walked not with the chosen few who saw thee from the earth ascend; who raised to heav'n their wondering view, then low to earth all prostrate bend; but we believe that human eyes beheld that journey to the skies; but we believe that human eyes beheld that journey to the skies.
