### Verse 1

He is my ev'rything, He is my all. He is my ev'rything, both great and small; He gave His life for me, made ev'rything new. He is my ev'rything, now how about you? Some folks may ask me, some folks may say: "Who is this Jesus you talk about ev'ry day?" He is my Savior, He set me free; Now listen while I tell you what He means to me!
