## Lyrics

### Verse 3

 In garments glorious He will come, To open wide the door; And I shall enter my heav'nly home, To dwell forevermore. 

### Chorus

Out of the ivory palaces, Into a world of woe; Only His great eternal love, Made my Savior go.

### Verse 1

My Lord has garments so wondrous fine, And myrrh their texture fills; Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine, With joy my being thrills.

### Verse 2

 His life had also its sorrows sore, For aloes had a part; And when I think of the cross He bore, My eyes with teardrops start.
