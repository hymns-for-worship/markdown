## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rose of Sharon ever blooming, Growing sweeter ev'ry day. Let Thy sweetness in completeness, Border all my wond'rous way. Let Thy fragrance live within me, Make my soul to ever sing, Praising Thee, Thou Rose of  Sharon, Precious flower, Gracious King. 

### Verse 2

Wond'rous Lily of the Valley, White beyond new fallen snow. Purer than the purest roses, Makes my soul within to glow. Pretty Lily of the Valley, Waiting not the dew nor rain, Shedding love and peace and gladness, Cleansing me of ev'ry stain.
