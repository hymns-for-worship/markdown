### Verse 1

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun does its successive journeys run; His kingdom spread from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more.

To Jesus endless pray'r be giv'n, and endless praises crown His head; His name like sweet perfume shall rise with ev'ry morning sacrifice.
