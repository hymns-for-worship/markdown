## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Day is dying in the west; Heav'n is touching earth with rest; Wait and worship while the night Sets her evening lamps a light Thru all the sky.

### Verse 2

Lord of life, beneath the dome Of the universe, Thy home, Gather us who seek Thy face To the fold of Thy embrace, for Thou are nigh.

### Verse 3

While the deep'ning shadows fall, Heart of love, enfolding all, thru the glory and the grace Of the stars that veil Thy face, Our hearts ascend.

### Chorus

Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts! Heav'n and earth are full of Thee; Heav'n and earth are praising Thee, O Lord Most High!

### Verse 4

When forever from our sight Pass the stars, the day, the night, Lord of angels, on our eyes Let eternal moring rise, and shadows end.
