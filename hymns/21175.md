## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have found here love and mercy from an infinite supply. I have found here living water from a well that won't run dry. At Your feet I bow in wonder. At Your feet I place my crowns. Let surrender be the only sound; at Your feet I lay me down. At Your feet I lay me down.

### Verse 2

Fear and failure, pride and hatred, You see all I've tried to hide. But sweet mercy has embraced me. Wrath has turned to life divine. At Your feet I bow in wonder. At Your feet I place my crowns. Let surrender be the only sound; at Your feet I lay me down. At Your feet I lay me down. At Your feet I bow in wonder. At Your feet I place my crowns. Let surrender be the only sound; at Your feet I lay me down. At Your feet I lay me down.
