## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul, What wondrous love is this, O my soul! What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul, To bear the dreadful curse for my soul!



### Verse 2

To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing, To God and to the Lamb I will sing; To God and to the Lamb, who is the great "I Am," While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing, While millions join the theme, I will sing!



### Verse 3

And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on, And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on; And when from death I'm free, I'll sing and joyful be, And through eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on, and through eternity I'll sing on!
