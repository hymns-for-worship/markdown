## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O I have heard the wondrous story of God's great love for you and me, In giving Jesus a perfect off'ring and now from sin we might be free.

### Verse 2

I have believed the glorious message of Jesus' vict'ry o'er death and sin, In triumph risen to heav'n ascended and now at God's right hand doth reign.

### Verse 3

I have obeyed the things commanded to be a child of God most high. My love for Him will be expanded while death and Judgment draweth nigh.

### Chorus

O, I will praise Him, ever upraise Him, my blessed Lord who died for me. His loving kindness, bro't full salvation and ever grateful I shall be.
