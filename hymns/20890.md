## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Unity in harmony, In fellowship and song; We praise the Lord for His great love And thank Him all day long. Unity in harmony, We gladly blend our hearts; Our lives a complex symphony, We are God's glorious art.

### Verse 2

Unity in harmony, In hope, and faith, and love; Baptized into God's family; We serve His Name above. Unity in harmony, One Spirit, Lord, and God; One body and one fellowship To which we have been called.

### Verse 3

Unity in harmony, We sing with one accord; We eat the bread, we drink the cup, Communing with the Lord. Unity in harmony, In worship, and in prayer; Together we all hear God's word  And all our blessings share.
