## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord of our highest love! Let now Thy peace be giv'n; Fix all our tho'ts on things above, Our hearts on Thee in heav'n.



### Verse 2

Then, dearest Lord, draw near Whilst we Thy table spread, And crown the feast with heav'nly cheer, Thyself the living bread.

 

### Verse 3

Then as the loaf we break, Thine own rich blessing give; May all with loving hearts partake, And all new strength receive.


### Verse 4

Dear Lord! What mem'ries crowd Around the sacred cup! The upper room! Gethsemane! Thy foes! Thy lifting up!



### Verse 5

O, scenes of suff'ring love, Enough our souls to win— Enough to melt our hearts and prove The antidote of sin.
