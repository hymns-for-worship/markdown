## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In His image God created you; In new birth He gave you life anew; And His matchless love you now proclaim; You must live to glorify His name.

### Verse 2

You were bought at such an awful price. Christ redeemed you by His sacrifice. You obeyed Him and were free from sin, Peace and hope and joy and love within.

### Verse 3

Let your light be bright and ever true; Live so others will see Christ in you. In your life a sermon sinners see What the Christian life is meant to be.

### Chorus

Christian remember who you are today; As you follow Him along the way. Tho' the way seems dark and the journey far, Strength comes when you remember who you are.
