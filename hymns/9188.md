## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are going to heaven singing a song, Never to wander, never to roam. In that city up yonder we'll never grow old, Happy forever while ages roll on.

### Verse 2

We are trav'ling the highway Jesus hath trod. Onward to heaven, home to our God. In a home that's eternal beyond this dark vale. Jesus is waiting, His glory we'll share.

### Verse 3

In our journey to heaven, we press along, Our faith in Jesus guiding us home. Over Jordan's rough waters to Canaan's fair land; Praising forever our glorious King.

### Chorus

We'll be free from sorrow in that land so fair; God's light will shine forever, For there is no night there, Singing praise to our Father around that great throne, Thanks to our Savior, yes, we're going home.
