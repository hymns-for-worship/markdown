## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When with the Savior we enter the gloryland, won't it be wonderful there? Ended the troubles and cares of the storyland, won't it be wonderful there?

### Verse 2

Walking and talking with Christ, the suppernal one, won't it be wonderful there? Praising, adoring the matchless eternal one, won't it be wonderful there?

### Verse 3

There where the tempest will never be sweeping us, won't it be wonderful there? Sure that forever the Lord will be keeping us, won't it be wonderful there?

### Chorus

Won't it be wonderful there? Having no burdens to bear? Joyously singing with heartbells all ringing, o won't it be wonderful there?
