  Give to our God immortal praise; Mercy and truth are all His ways: Wonders of grace to God belong; Repeat His mercies in your song.

 He built the earth,  He spread the sky, And fixed the starry lights on high: Wonders of grace to God belong; Repeat His mercies in your song.

### Verse 3

 He sent His Son with pow'r to save From guilt and darkness and the grave: Wonders of grace to God belong; Repeat His mercies in your song.

 Thru this vast world He guides our feet, And leads us to His heav'nly seat: His mercies ever shall endure, When this our world shall be no more.
