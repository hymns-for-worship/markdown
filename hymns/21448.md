## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I walk the old, old pathway Beside a faithful friend, And often hear His presence near, "Lo I am with you always And will be to the end."

### Verse 2

Ahead are dear disciples Who walked this very ground; From year to year, they passed through here And lined the way with Bibles To mark the path they found.

### Verse 3

At times along my journey I close my eyes in prayer And faintly see not far from me A meadow green with mercy And loved ones standing there.

### Verse 4

The camp that lies before me Is joined in pleasant song; Immanuel has come to dwell And spread the tent of glory That I have sought so long.
