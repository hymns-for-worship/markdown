### Verse 1

Hide me, O my Savior, hide me, In Thy holy place; Resting there beneath Thy glory, O let me see Thy face.

Hide me, when the storm is raging O'er life's troubled sea; Like a dove on ocean's billows, O let me fly to Thee. 

### Verse 3

Hide me, when my heart is breaking With its weight of woe; When in tears I seek the comfort Thou canst alone bestow.

Hide me, Hide me, O blessed Savior, hide me; O Savior, Keep me Safely O Lord, with Thee. Hide me, hide me, safely hide me, O my Savior, keep Thou me,
