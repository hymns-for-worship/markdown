# 562 - No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus

## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus, Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true; I would tell you how He changed my life completely, He did something that no other friend could do. 

### Verse 2

 All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me, All my heart was full of misery and woe; Jesus placed His strong and loving arms about me, And He led me in the way I ought to go. 

### Verse 3

 Ev'ry day He comes to me with new assurance, More and more I understand His words of love; But I'll never know just why He came to save me, Till some day I see His blessed face above. 

### Chorus

No one ever cared for me like Jesus, There's no other friend so kind as He, No one else could take the sin and darkness from me, O how much He cared for me.
