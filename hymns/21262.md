## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How I love You, Lord, How I seek Your Truth; Lord, My life is wholly devoted to You. As I live each day, May my path be straight; Help me not decide, Lord, to go my own way. Lord, help me live just as You say, I know there's no other way.

### Verse 2

Father, take my life, Use me day and night; May each moment I live be pure in Thy sight. Lord, I give to Thee all that I can be; May the light of Jesus be shining in me. I pray that ev'ry soul can see Christ Jesus living in me. 

### Coda

Help me, Lord, Hear my cry, Take my life. Amen.
