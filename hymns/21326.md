## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O God, be merciful to me, My soul for refuge comes to Thee; Beneath Thy wings I safe will stay Until these troubles pass away.

### Verse 2

To God most High shall rise my prayer, To God Who makes my wants His care; From heav'n He will salvation send, And me from ev'ry foe defend. 

### Verse 3

Great foes and fierce my soul alarm, Inflamed with rage and strong to harm, But God, from heav'n His dwellingplace, Will rescue me with truth and grace.

### Verse 4

Be Thou, O God, exalted high, Yea, far above the starry sky, And let Thy glory be displayed O'er all the earth thy hands have made.
