## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Awake, my soul, stretch ev'ry nerve, And press with vigor on; A heav'nly race demands thy zeal, And an immortal crown, And an immortal crown.


### Verse 2

A cloud of witnesses around, Hold thee in full survey: Forget the steps already trod, And onward urge thy way, And onward urge thy way.



### Verse 3

'Tis God's allanimating voice That calls thee from on high; 'Tis His own hand presents the prize To thine aspiring eye, To thine aspiring eye.



### Verse 4

Blest Savior, introduced by Thee, Have I my race begun; And, crowned with vict'ry at Thy feet I'll lay my honors down, I'll lay my honors down.
