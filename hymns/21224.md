## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a hope that burns within my heart, that gives me strength for ev'ry passing day; A glimpse of glory now revealed in meager part, yet drives all doubt away. I stand in Christ, with sins forgiv'n and Christ in me, the hope of heav'n. My highest calling, and my deepest joy, to make His will my home.

### Verse 2

There is a hope that lifts my weary head; A consolation, strong against despair that when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit, I find the Savior there. Thru present suff'rings, future's fear, He whispers courage in my ear; For I am safe in everlasting arms, and they will lead me home.

### Verse 3

There is a hope that stands the test of time, that lifts my eyes beyond the beck'ning grave to see the matchless beauty of a day divine, when I behold His face. When suff'rings cease, and sorrows die, and ev'ry longing satisfied; Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul, for I am truly home. When suff'rings cease, and sorrows die, and ev'ry longing satisfied; Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul, for I am truly home.
