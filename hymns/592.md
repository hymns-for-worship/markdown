# 592 - I Want To Be Ready To Meet Him

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 You may have your worldly pleasures, your silver and your gold, You may pile up all the riches that this old world can hold; But I'd rather have my Savior, and with Him firmly stand, 

### Verse 2

 You may talk about your riches, your diamonds and your pearls, You may gain the wealth for ages of this and all the worlds, But the Savior is more precious, with Him I'll take my stand,

### Verse 3

 There is one thing I can boast of, salvation from the fall, I'm an heir to wealth in glory, my Father owns it all; That is why I'm shouting happy and go at His command,

### Chorus

I want to be ready to meet Him by and by, I want to be ready to meet Him in the sky, O, I want to be more like Him, and do His blest command, For I want to be ready to meet Him in the gloryland.
