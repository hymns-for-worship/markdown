## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Through all the web of world events, there's woven in God's providence. He sees the end before the start; then works His plan from ev'ry part.

### Verse 2

Our finite minds can't understand the way He rules in ev'ry land. But by the called, 'tis understood; for them He works all things for good.

### Chorus

The Lord is at hand. The Lord is at hand. So worry not, nor doubt His care; Take ev'rything to God in prayer.

### Verse 3

Our loving Lord does chasten us; it is by trials we learn to trust. Then humble hearts this praise will swell: our gracious God does all thing well.

### Verse 4

Lord, please forgive our doubt and fear; we  have Your help when trials are near. Your children are not left alone, but by Your word, You lead them home.
