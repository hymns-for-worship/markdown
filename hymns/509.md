## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 We shall  stand be fore the throne, Stand with all, but stand alone, Face, at last, the Aged One. God is holy; bow before Him. 

### Verse 2

 See the vindicated Son, Hear Him say, "Depart, Well done," Judgment sure for ev'ryone. Christ is holy; listen to Him.

### Verse 3

 On His left, the doomed implore, But are locked beneath a door, There they burn forever more. God is holy; love and fear Him.

### Verse 4

 But the faithful on His right, Wearing crowns and garments white, Sing forever in His sight, "Holy, holy, Thou art holy."
