## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Since I heard His word now my heart is stirred And I've seen a better way. I have reached the end of the paths of sin and there dawns a great new day. Fair and bright the light that shows the way, likes of which I've never known; And I have no care for the devil's snare for I'm led in safely home. 

### Verse 2

There is joy and peace by the narrow way and it will forever be; For by God's own grace I shall see His face And His hand extend for me. What a joyful sound, I'm homeward  bound And the trump of God I hear; And the sacred songs of the angel throng as they sing in that great choir.
