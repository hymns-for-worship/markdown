## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Another week with all its cares hath flown, Another day of rest and peace is here; Sweet day on which our wearied hearts are drawn In holy fellowship to Jesus near.

### Verse 2

Jesus, our great High Priest, our Sacrifice,  Our Passover, rich gift of love divine, With Thee we would into the holiest rise, Communing with Thee in the bread and wine.

### Verse 3

O what a feast ineffable is this, Thy table spread with more than angels' food! Angels the highest never taste the bliss, The dear communion of Thy flesh and blood.

### Verse 4

May we as servants joy to do Thy will, As sons the honor of Thy house maintain, As soldiers stand prepared for conflict still, And count all suff'ring borne for Thee as gain.
