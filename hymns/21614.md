## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Before Jehovah's awful throne, Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone; He can create and He destroy.



### Verse 2

His sov'reign pow'r, without our aid, Made us of clay, and formed us men; And when like wand'ring sheep we strayed, He brought us to His fold again.



### Verse 3

We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs, High as the heav'ns our voices raise; And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.



### Verse 4

Wide as the world is Thy command, Vast as eternity Thy love; Firm as a rock Thy truth shall stand When rolling years shall cease to move.
