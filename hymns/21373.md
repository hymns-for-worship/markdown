O my soul, bless God the Father; All within me bless His name; Bless the Father, and forget not All His mercies to proclaim.

Far as east from west is diStant, He has put away our sin; Like the pity of a father Has the LORD'S compassion been.

Unto such as keep His cov'nant And are steadfast in His way; Unto those who still remember His commandments, and obey.
