## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nearer the cross, my heart can say, I am coming nearer; Nearer the cross from day to day, I am coming nearer; Nearer the cross where Jesus died, Nearer the fountain's crimson tide, Nearer my Savior's wounded side, I am coming nearer, I am coming nearer.

### Verse 2

Nearer the Christian's mercyseat, I am coming nearer; Feasting my soul on manna sweet, I am coming nearer; Stronger in faith, more clear I see Jesus, Who gave Himself for me; Nearer to Him I still would be, Still I'm coming nearer, Still I'm coming nearer.

### Verse 3

Nearer in pray'r my hope aspires, I am coming nearer; Deeper the love my soul desires, I am coming nearer; Nearer the end of toil and care, Nearer the joy I long to share, Nearer the crown I soon shall wear, I am coming nearer, I am coming nearer.
