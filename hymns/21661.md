## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a thief when we're not watching, Will appear the Glory day, While we're trusting that tomorrow, We'll be going 'bout our way. Like a thief out in the darkness, Neither seen nor either known, Is the coming of our Master, When He comes to claim His own. 



### Verse 2

Will His children all be ready? Will they know anxiety? Can we hope He'll find us waiting, When He comes for you and me? Yes, we'll rise to His appearing, And we'll fly so far away, Shouting Praise Him!   Alleluia! On that Glory, Glory day.
