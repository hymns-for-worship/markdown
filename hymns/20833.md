## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine; living with Jesus a new life divine; Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine, Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.



### Verse 2

Never a trial that He is not there, Never a burden that He doth not bear, Never a sorrow that He doth not share, Moment by moment I'm under His care.



### Verse 3

Never a heartache and never a groan, Never a teardrop and never a moan;  Never a danger but there on the throne, Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

### Verse 4

Never a weakness that He doth not feel, Never a sickness that He cannot heal;  Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,*  Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.





Moment by moment I'm kept in His love; Moment by moment I've life from above; Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

### Chorus

Moment by moment I'm kept in His love; Moment by moment I've life from above; Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
