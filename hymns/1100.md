### Verse 1

Your only Son no sin to hide, But You have sent Him from Your side To walk upon this guilty sod And to become the Lamb of God.

### Verse 2

Your gift of love they crucified, They laughed and scorned Him as He died, The humble King they named a fraud And sacrificed the Lamb of God.

### Verse 3

I was so lost I should have died, But You have bro't me to Your side To be led by Your staff and rod, And to be called the Lamb of God.

### Chorus

O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the holy Lamb of God; O wash me in His precious blood, My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
