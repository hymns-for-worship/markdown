## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Bread of Life, pure Living Water, Lover of my soul, In my weakness be my strength to reach the final goal.

### Verse 2

Hope of heaven, loving Father, Keeper of my soul,  Take my lovesick heart And make it shine like purest gold.  

### Verse 3

Lamb of God, dear hope of glory, Savior crucified, By Your blood I am redeemed my debt now satisfied.   

### Verse 4

Precious holy Lord and King So full of love and grace. Tho' I live or tho' I die I rest in Your embrace! Tho' they slay me, tho' I fall; in darkness You are light, Jesus. I will keep my eyes on You till my faith becomes  sight. I will keep my eyes on You till my faith becomes  sight.
