# 168 - Beneath The Cross Of Jesus

## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand, the shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land; a home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way, from the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day.

### Verse 2

Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye it seems can see the very dying form of One who suffered there for me; and from my smitten heart with tears two wonders I confess, the wonders of His glorious love, and my unworthiness.

### Verse 3

I take, o cross, thy shadow for my abiding place; I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face; content to let the world go by, to know no gain or loss, my sinfull self my only shame, my glory all the cross.
