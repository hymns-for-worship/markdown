## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How strong is the love of a man for his wife, He cares for her as a pearl; But there is a love that is greater far than all others in the world.

### Verse 2

How deep is the love of a mother for her child, she cares for her day and night; But there is a love that is greater still, It lasts thru the end of time.

### Verse 3

How warm is the love of a friend dear and true on whom you can depend; But there is a love that is greater yet, A love that will never end.

### Chorus

The greatest of all the loves comes down from the Father above, He gave Jesus' life as a sacrifice, It's the greatest of all the loves.
