## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If thou but suffer God to guide thee, And hope in Him thru all thy ways, He'll give thee strength whate'er betide thee, And bear thee thru the evil days; Who trust in God's unchanging love Builds on the rock that naught can move.



### Verse 2

What can these anxious cares avail thee, These neverceasing moans and sighs! What can it help, if thou bewail thee O'er each dark moment as it flies? Our cross and trials do but press The heavier for our bitterness.

### Verse 3

Only be still, and wait His leisure In cheerful hope, with heart content To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure And alldiscerning love hath sent; Nor doubt our inmost wants are known To Him who chose us for His own.

### Verse 4

Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving, So do thine own part faithfully, And trust His Wordâ€“ Tho' undeserving, Thou yet shalt find it true for thee; God never yet forsook at need The soul that trusted Him indeed.
