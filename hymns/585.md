## Notation

D - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I am not skilled to understand What God has willed, what God has planned; I only know at His right hand Is One who is my Savior!

### Verse 2

 I take Him at His word indeed: "Christ died for sinners," this I read; For in my heart I find a need Of Him to be my Savior!

### Verse 3

 That He should leave His place on high And come for sinful man to die, You count it strange? So once did I, Before I knew my Savior!

### Verse 4

 And O, that He fulfilled may see The travail of His soul in me, And with His work contented be, As I with my dear Savior!

### Verse 5

 Yes, living, dying, let me bring My strength, my solace from this spring; That He who lives to be my King Once died to be my Savior!
