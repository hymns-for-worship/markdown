## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Hear the blessed Savior calling the oppressed, "O ye heavy laden, come to me and rest; Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear, Bring me ev'ry burden, bring me ev'ry care."

### Verse 2

 Have you cares of bus'ness, cares of pressing debt? Cares of social life or cares of hopes unmet? Are you by remorse or sense of guilt depressed? Come right now to Jesus, He will give you rest.

### Chorus

Come unto me, I will give you rest; Take my yoke upon you, Hear me and be blest; I am meek and lowly, Come and trust my might; Come my yoke is easy, And my burden's light.
