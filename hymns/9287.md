## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart; Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art: Thou my best thought, by day or by night, Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

### Verse 2

Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word; I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord: Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son, Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee, one.

### Verse 3

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise, Thou my inheritance now and always: Thou and Thou only are first in my heart, High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

### Verse 4

High King of heaven, my victory won, May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'ns Sun! Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
