## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Our wonderful home so far away, we see by faith a beautiful sight. O help us, Lord, to reach our home, Where flows the pure river of life.

### Verse 2

Our wonderful home so far away, It is built by God prepared for the soul. There's no night there but eternal day, In the city more precious than gold.

### Verse 3

In our Father's home we'll ever live. With Christ our Lord who saved us from sin. He'll bless with peace forever more. When He says: "Come, enter in."
