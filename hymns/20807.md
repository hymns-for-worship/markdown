## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Are you walking in His footsteps, Are you always doing good; Do you follow after Jesus As sincerely as you should? Do you travel in the pathway That will shine with brighter light, Till you reach the mansions younder, In the land of pure delight?

### Verse 2

Are you walking in His footsteps, Do you ever seek the lost In the mountainss and the desert, Whatsoe'er may be the cost? In the highway and the byways, Are your footsteps ever found, Where His weary feet so footsore, Left their marks upon the ground? 

### Verse 3

Are you walking in His footsteps, As He bids you daily do; Do you follow near the Savior, With Him constantly in view? In the sunshine and the shadow, In the darkness and the light, Are you pressing in your journey To the land of pure delight?

### Chorus

Are you walking in His footsteps? Are you always doing good? Do you follow after Jesus? As sincerely as you should?
