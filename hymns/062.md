# 062 - Did You Think To Pray

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ere you left your room this morning, did you think to pray? In the name of Christ, our Savior, did you sue for loving favor, as a shield today?

### Verse 2

When your heart was filled with anger, did you think to pray? Did you plead for grace, my brother, that you might forgive another who had crossed your way?

### Verse 3

When sore trials came upon you, did you think to pray? When your soul was bowed in sorrow, balm of Gilead did you borrow at the gates of day?

### Chorus

O how praying rests the weary! Prayer can change the night to day; so when life seems dark and dreary, don't forgive to pray.
