## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One offer of salvation, To all the world make known; The only sure foundation Is Christ the cornerstone.



### Verse 2

One only door of heaven Stands open wide today, One sacrifice is given, 'Tis Christ, the living way.



### Verse 3

My only song and story Isâ€” Jesus died for me; My only hope for glory, The cross of Calvary.

### Chorus

No other name is given, No other way is known, 'Tis Jesus Christ the first and last, He saves, and He alone.
