### Verse 1

In need of grace. In need of love. In need of mercy raining down from high above. In need of strength. In need of peace. In need of things that only You can give to me. In need of Christ, the perfect Lamb, my refuge strong, the great I AM! This is my song, my humble plea; I am Your child, I am in need. In need of Christ, I am in need. I am Your child, I am in need.
