## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are five steps to being a Christian ev'ry one should hear, The first one is to hear the gospel; open now your ears. The second is you must believe With all your heart and soul. To do this you must read and study, then you'll reach your goal.

### Verse 2

The third one is you must repent, you must so sorry be. You can't make Jesus have regrets He hung upon the tree. Confession is your next step; You'll stand before mankind; You state your faith with all your love and boldness of your mind.

### Verse 3

Baptism is the final step, this cleans your fragile soul. You die to sin all black within, Is washed away you know. A Christian are you now dear, Pure as the driven snow; But you must do all His commands to die and Heaven go.
