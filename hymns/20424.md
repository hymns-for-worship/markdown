## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When God shut Noah in the grand old ark, He put a rainbow in the cloud. When the thunders rolled and the sky was dark, God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. When it looked like the sun wouldn't shine anymore, God put a rainbow in the cloud.

### Verse 2

Away down yonder in Egypt's sand, God put a rainbow in the cloud. Just to lead His chldren to the promised land, God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. When it looked like the sun wouldn't shine anymore, God put a rainbow in the cloud.

### Verse 3

When they put old Daniel in the Lion's den, God put a rainbow in the cloud. Just to prove His promise to the sons of me, God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. When it looked like the sun wouldn't shine anymore, God put a rainbow in the cloud.

### Verse 4

O, Jordan deep and Jordan wide, God put a rainbow in the cloud. To lead His people to the other side. God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. God put a rainbow in the cloud. When it looked like the sun wouldn't shine anymore, God put a rainbow in the cloud, yes in the cloud.
