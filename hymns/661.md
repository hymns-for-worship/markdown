### Verse 1

 O will you now from sighing cease? O will you seek the path of peace? Give Christ your heart, make heav'n your goal, Let Jesus dwell within your soul.

### Verse 2

 Thru trials oft your soul must go, The Savior wills this to be so, Trust Him with all, as they of old, old, Let Jesus dwell within your soul.

### Verse 3

 And when the hour of death draws near, Trust Him to take away all fear, The joys of heav'n will soon unfold, Let Jesus dwell within your soul.
