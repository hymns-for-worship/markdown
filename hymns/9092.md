## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He walked, He walked upon the lowest earht And tasted our dusty way, That those who trace his steps may tast A sweeter hope each day.

### Verse 2

He walked, He walked upon the leaping waves, Commanded the crashing sea, That mortal lips with no such pow'r May tell His deity.

### Verse 4

He'll walk,  may it be soon! He'll walk the clouds  Through sky soon to flee away, That I may join the Son of Man And walk the golden way!
