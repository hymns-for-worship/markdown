## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come, walk upon the highway of holiness. Come walk in His paths, the Way of the blessed. O come walk upon the Way of holiness, Now summoned from Each and West.  You have come from many lands, brought together to His Way, gathered for His praise.

### Verse 2

Lift up your hearts, Christ Jesus will be your guide, His banner ahead, His Word at your side. O come Walk in the Way of holiness, We are called to Zion summoned from the East and West. You’ve come together to His Way, gathered for His praise.

### Verse 3

Strengthen the weak, encourage each fainting soul With gladness and joy, make haste to the goal. Walk in the Way of holiness Now summoned from East and West. You come together to His Way, gathered, fashioned for the glory of His praise.
