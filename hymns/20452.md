## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Oh what a thought ! What impossible presumption! To be the servant, the child of The Creator. Sing, Hallelujah! My bondage is to Righteousness. For I am His, to serve Him forever.

### Verse 2

How great the awe! How improbable the blessing! To work before Him in gratitude and honor. Sing Hallelujah! I tend His peace, His Holiness. For I am His, to serve Him forever.

### Verse 3

Colossal love! Inconceivable to mortals. It freely draws me to choose Him as my Master. Sing, Hallelujah! My hope stands firm on Faithfulness. For I am His, to serve Him forever.
