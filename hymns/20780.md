## Notation

C - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 My latest sun is sinking fast, My race is nearly run; My strongest trials now are past, My triumph is begun!

### Verse 2

 I know I'm nearing holy ranks of saints and angels dear; I brush the dew of Jordan's banks: The crossing must be near.

### Verse 3

 I've almost gained my heav'nly home, My spirit loudly sings; The holy ones, behold they come! I hear the noise of wings.

### Verse 4

 O bear my longing heart to Him Who bled and died for me; Whose blood now cleanses from all sin, And gives me victory.

### Chorus

O come, angel band. Come, and around me stand; O bear me away on your snowy wings To my immortal home; my immortal home.
