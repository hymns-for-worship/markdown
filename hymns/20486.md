## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Father is rich in houses and lands, he holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands! Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold, his coffers are full, he has riches untold.

### Verse 2

My father's own son, the Savior of men, Once wandered o'er earth as the poorest of them; But now He is reigning in glory on high, Preparing a place for the sweet by and by.

### Verse 3

A tent or a cottage, why should I care? They're building a palace for me over there! Tho' here I'm a stranger yet still I may sing: All glory to God, I'm a child of the King!

### Chorus

I'm a child of the King, a child of the King! With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King.
