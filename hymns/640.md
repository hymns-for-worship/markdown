### Verse 1

 Lamp of Life, come show me the way; Light my night, O Star of the Day; Lest I fall on feet made of clay, Lamp of Life, light up my heart.

### Verse 2

 Word of Life, please temper my tongue; Give me words, Lord, grace ev'ry one; Let my speech bring sorrow to none; Word of Life, live in my heart.

### Verse 3

 Lord of Life, let my hands be Thine; Help me now, forget they are mine; Move my feet with Thy will divine; Lord of Life, rule in my heart.
