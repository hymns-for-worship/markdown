## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Our day of praise is done, The evening shadows fall; But pass not from us with the sun, True light that lightest all.

### Verse 2

Around the throne on high, Where night can never be, The white-robed angels of the sky Bring ceaseless hymns to Thee.

### Verse 3

'Tis Thine each soul to calm, Each wayward tho't reclaim, And make our life a daily psalm Of glory to Thy name.

### Verse 4

A little while, and then Shall come the glorious end; And songs of angels and of men In perfect praise shall blend.
