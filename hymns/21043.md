## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am so glad that our Father in heav'n Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n; Wonderful things in the Bible I see, This is the dearest: that Jesus loves me.

### Verse 2

Tho' I forget Him and wander away, Still He doth love me wherever I stray; Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, When I remember that Jesus loves me.

### Verse 3

O there is only one song I can sing, When in His beauty I see the great King; This shall my song in eternity be, "O what a wonder that Jesus loves me."

### Chorus

I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.
