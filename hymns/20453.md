### Verse 1

Let us know Jehovah; Come, let us press on, For His way is certain, Certain as the dawn. He will come to bless us Like the fall of rain, Like the rain of springtime, Watering the plain.

### Verse 2

Though the Lord has torn us, He will heal again; Though the Lord has struck us, He will bind our pain. After days of mourning, We will be restored, Thus to live before Him; Let us seek the Lord.
