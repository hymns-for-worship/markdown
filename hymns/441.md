## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Once far from God and dead in sin, No light my heart could see; But in God's Word the light I found, Now Christ liveth in me. 

### Verse 2

 As rays of light from yonder sun, The flow'rs of earth set free, So life and light and love came forth From Christ living in me.

### Verse 3

With longing all my heart is filled, That like Him I may be, As on the wondrous tho't I dwell That Christ liveth in me. 

### Chorus

Christ liveth in me, Christ liveth in me, O! what a salvation this, That Christ liveth in me.
