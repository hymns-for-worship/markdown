## Notation

C - 3/4 on 2+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The young man's heart was filled with fear When he beheld the foe so near;  "A-las! what shall we do?" he cried; His Master, strong in faith, replied:

### Verse 2

Elisha pray'd, "Lord, I pray Thee, Open his eyes that he may see." The pray'r was heard, he looked around And there the fiery chariots found.

### Verse 3

And thus we find from day to day Our foes surround to stop our way, But tho' they're near, we'll ne'er forget God's mighty host is nearer yet.

### Verse 4

Then quickly rise, dismiss your fear, For needed help is always near; the hosts of God around us stand, More strong than all the hostile band.

### Chorus

Then fear ye not, fresh courage take, The God we serve will ne'er forsake; Tho' now unseen, around us lies God's mighty army of the skies.
