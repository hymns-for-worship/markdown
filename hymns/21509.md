### Verse 1

Come ev'ry soul by sin oppressed, There's mercy with the Lord, And He will surely give you rest By trusting in His Word.

### Verse 2

For Jesus shed His precious blood, Rich blessing to bestow; Plunge now into the crimson flood That washes white as snow.

### Verse 3

Yes, Jesus is the Truth, The Way, That leads you into rest; Obey His Word, Without delay And you are fully blest.

### Verse 4

Come, then, and join this holy band, And on to glory go, To dwell in that celestial land, Where joys immortal flow.


### Chorus

Trust the Savior, trust the Savior, Obey Jesus now; He will save you, He will save you, Obey His Word now.
