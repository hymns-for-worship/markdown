## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rock in the desert, my shield from the blast Under Thy shadow I'm hiding at last; Dear is Thy refuge, and welcome to me; Rock in the desert, my soul flies to Thee.

### Verse 2

Rock in the desert, how lovely the star, Guiding my footsteps from wand'ring afar; Now I am happy, Thy shelter I see; Rock in the desert, my faith clings to Thee.

### Verse 3

Rock in the desert, how peaceful my rest, Kindly protected, no longer oppressed; Long have I thirsted for streams cool and free. Rock in the desert, I find them in Thee.

### Verse 4

Rock in the desert, O Savior divine, Thou art my refuge, no love is like Thine; Thou my Redeemer art gracious to me; Rock in the desert, I live but in Thee.

### Chorus

My soul, my soul, My soul, my soul, Rock in the desert, Rock in the desert, Rock in the desert, my soul flies to Thee.
