# 21158 - AFTER ALL

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Trials here are some-times many, And ofttimes my feet grow weary, 'Til it seems I almost stumble then and fall; But the tender hand that leads me is the hand that keeps me steady, And by faith I know I'll make it after all.

### Verse 2

By myself I cannot make it, But I know He's there to help me, He will hear my cry if only I will call; "Just keep trusting, keep on believing" are the words I hear Him whisper, "Just a few more days to labor after all."

### Chorus

After all this life is over, And our burdens have been lifted, And we stand upon the mountain top so tall, Looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing, Gives me faith that I can make it after all!
