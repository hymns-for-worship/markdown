## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my way groweth drear, precious Lord, linger near, when my llife is almost gone; hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall; take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

### Verse 2

When the shadows appear, and the night draweth near, and the day is past and gone; at the river I stand, guide my feet, hold my hand; take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

### Verse 3

Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand, I am tired, I am weak, I am worn; thru the storm, thru the night, lead me on to the light; take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.
