## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - LA

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my love to Christ grows weak, When for deeper faith I seek, Then in tho't I go to thee, Garden of Gethsemane. 

### Verse 2

There I walk amid the shades While the ling'ring twilight fades, See that suff'ring, friendless One, Weeping, praying there alone. 


### Verse 3

When my love for man grows weak, When for stronger faith I seek, Hill of Calvary I go To thy scenes of fear and woe.

### Verse 4

There behold His agony, Suffered on the bitter tree; See His anguish, see His faith, Love triumphant still in death.

### Verse 5

Then to life I turn again, Learning all the worth of pain, Learning all the might that lies In a full selfsacrifice.
