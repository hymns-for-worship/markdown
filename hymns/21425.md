## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I came to the cross and what did I see? A mother there weeping for her son on a tree. I came to the cross and what did I see? A soldier there bowing who knew this was He. And then I saw Him, and then I saw Him. I saw my blessed Savior hanging there for me. 

### Verse 2

I came to the cross and what did I hear? The pounding of nails into those hands so dear. I came to the cross and what did I hear? The cruel crowd mocking as they came to jeer. And then I heard Him, and then I heard Him. I heard my Savior crying, "God, why aren't You near?" 

### Verse 3

I come to the cross and what do I know? That Jesus was willing to come down below. I come to the cross and what do I know? He suffered in sorrow in pain and in woe. And this I know now, and this I know now: I know my blessed Savior surely loves me so. 

### Verse 4

I come to the cross and what must I say? I'm sorry my sins caused such shame on that day. I come to the cross and what must I say? I grieve for the debt that my Lord had to pay. But I'm so thankful, but I'm so thankful; Thankful my Savior came and gave to us the Way.
