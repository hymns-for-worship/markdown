## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am looking for treasure eternal; I am longing to dwell in that land where my savior has promised to build me a mansion with his own hand.

### Verse 2

Dearest friendships are the only treasure I can claim on this earth as my own; but in heaven I'm blessed beyond measure: praise the Lord, I'm coming home!

### Verse 3

Since the way of the world is enticing, oft the pathway of sin I did roam, but obdedience to his word has saved me: praise the Lord, I'm coming home!

### Chorus

God has promised his saints thru the ages he'll provide in that land o'er the foam; with each day I get closer to heaven: praise the Lord, I'm coming home.
