## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Love, great love, Eternal love great love. Before the forming of the world when nothing had been done. They shared in one eternal love, Father, Spirit and the Son.

### Verse 2

Love, great love, Eternal love great love. The Son took flesh to dwell with us And loved us to the end, For none can have a greater love Than dying for his friends.

### Verse 3

Love, great love, Eternal love great love. And thus, the love before the world Is now our righteousness; our hope is not that we loved God, But that He first loved us.
