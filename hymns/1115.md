## Notation

D - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, Father, I do sin, and my heart breaks deep within; For You have sought me, yet I turn away from all Your loving care. So often do I fall, yet You reach out again, Lifting my burden that is more than I can ever bear.

### Verse 2

Thro' Your beloved Son, there is grace so undeserved; How can I ever sin against the One Who makes my heart to sing? Create a heart so clean that like You, I may be, As light of Morning rises up with healing in its wings.

### Verse 3

My broken contrite heart is so worthless in my sight; But You restore it, give it peace and joy to love and follow You. O, may I ever try to strive pure in Your sight. Filled with Your goodness, free to glorify and honor You.
