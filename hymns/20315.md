My God and I, against all the world, fighting temptation, evil, and sin. My God and I, against all the world, Using the armor He has prepared, zealous for battle,

My God and I, together we fight, clashing with men, with sin they pursue. He will not fail me wheree'er I go, He will be with me,

With His help, I will be radiant in holiness. I will be loyal with faithfulness. I will be zealous in righteousness. Filled with His Spirit, wisdom and might! We win the battle, we win the fight! My God, and I, my God and I.
