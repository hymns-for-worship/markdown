## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.

### Verse 2

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved; How pre-cious did that grace appear the hour I first believed. My chains are gone, I've been set free; my God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood His mercy rains, unending love, amazing grace!

### Verse 3

Thru many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.

### Verse 4

When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun; We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun. My chains are gone, I've been set free; my God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood His mercy rains, unending love, amazing grace!
