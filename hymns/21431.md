## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If you could see Christ standing here tonight, His thorncrowned head and pierced hands could view; Could see those eyes that beam with heav'n's own light, And hear Him say:  "Beloved, 'twas for you!"

### Verse 2

If you could see that face, so calm and sweet, Those lips that spake words only pure and true; Could see the nailprints in His tender feet, And hear Him say: "Beloved, 'twas for you!" 

### Verse 3

He whispers to your heart; turn not aaway, For He's beside you in your narrow pew! If you will listen you will hear Him say, In living tones:  "Beloved, 'twas for you!"

### Chorus

Would you believe and Jesus receive, If He were standing here? If He were standing here?
