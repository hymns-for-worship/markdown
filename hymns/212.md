## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a land that is fairer than day, and by faith we can see it afar; for the savior waits over the way, to prepare us a dwelling place there.

### Verse 2

We shall sing on that beautiful shore the melodious songs of the blest, and our spirits shall sorrow no more, not a sigh for the blessings of rest.

### Verse 3

To our bountiful Father above, we will offer our tribute of praise, for the glorious gift of his love, and the blessings that hallow our days.

### Chorus

In the sweet by and by, we shall meet on that beautiful shore, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beatiful shore.
