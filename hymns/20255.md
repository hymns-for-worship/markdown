## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In my mind I'm sometimes led, To the time when God has said: Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Jesus. All the righteous ones of old, Numbered multitude untold, Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Him.

### Verse 2

I can picture Seraph's wings, Almost hear the chorus sing, "Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Je-sus." Even those who were ashamed, Never magnified His name, Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Him.

### Verse 3

I can see Him standing there, Righteous Son, the chosen Heir, "Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Jesus." As I look upon His face, Know the measure of His grace, Ev'ry knee shall bow down to Him.

### Chorus

O, dear Jesus I praise Thy name I know someday all knees shall bow.
