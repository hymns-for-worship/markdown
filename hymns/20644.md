## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Was it his beautiful coat, his very colorful coat, the coat his daddy made just for him, that made his brothers jealous, so very jealous, that they threw him into a pit.

### Verse 2

Or was it one of his dreams, a dream where he was supreme, a dream his brothers bowed down to him, that made his brothers jealous, so very jealous, that they threw him into a pit.

### Verse 3

What if your friend gets a toy, a toy he really enjoys, a toy that you've always wanted too? Now don't go being jealous. No, don't be jealous. Just be happy for your friend.
