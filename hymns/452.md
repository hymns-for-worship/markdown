## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's within my heart a melody Jesus whispers sweet and low, Fear not, I am with thee, peace be still, In all of life's ebb and flow.

### Verse 2

Feasting on the riches of His grace, Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing, Always looking on His smiling face, That is why I shout and sing.

### Verse 3

Â Soon He's coming back to welcome me Far beyond the starry sky; I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall live with Him on high. 

### Chorus

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus Sweetest name I know, Fills my ev'ry longing, Keeps me singing as I go.
