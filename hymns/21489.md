## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Trav'ling down life's pilgrim way, This my pray'r from day to day; "Lord, let come to me what may, Only give me, only give me, blessed Jesus.

### Verse 2

If mine eyes with tears o'erflow, When my loved ones from me go, I can drink my cup of woe, Only give me, only give me, blessed Jesus.

### Verse 3

If the sickle I must wield, Reaping in some foreign field, Glad obed'ence will I yield, Only give me, only give me, blessed Jesus.

### Verse 4

He's my hope when things go wrong, He's my help the whole day long, He's my life, my joy, my song, Only give me, only give me, blessed Jesus.

### Verse 5

When my work on earth is done, When my race below is run, When I see life's setting sun, Only give me, only give me, blessed Jesus.

### Chorus

Give me Jesus night and day, Give me Jesus all the way, I will bear both toil and care; Only give me blessed Jesus.
