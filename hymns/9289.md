### Verse 1

When sets my final sun, My journey Home begun, As my last song is sung, Look up with me!

### Verse 2

When I this earth forsake, As my last breath I take, While hearts around me break, Look up with me!

Tho light must surely fade, Sunlight in mortal shade. Toward heaven's shining gate, Look up with me!
