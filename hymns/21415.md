## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Bow down before the King of kings. With joyful noise, a psalm we sing: "The glorious and mighty One, The LORD of hosts has come."

### Verse 2

Rise up and join His forces strong. Take up the cry and shout the song: "Jehovah is a man of war, And the battle is the LORD'S!"

### Verse 3

Stand firm in armor of our God: Righteousness and truth, with the gospel shod, With Spirit's sword, helmet of the saved, Guarded by the shield of faith.

### Verse 4

Go forth 'gainst strongholds of the night Bringing captive ev'ry thought to Christ. And when our fight at last is o'er At His throne we will bow once more.
