### Verse 1

O when I think of my degradation, And when I think of my misery, Yes, when I think of my condemnation, O then I think of Blessed Calvary.

### Verse 2

He brought a message of beauty to me, It taught of peace and a life that's free. It changed my life now I'm His completely, O Hallelujah! Blessed Calvary.

### Verse 3

Yes, I am saved now, my soul He lifted, With Him I'll live thru eternity. Won't you accept Him, and so be gifted, He paved the way thru Blessed Calvary.

### Chorus

He came from heaven to save my soul, he came from  heaven to set me free, That's why I'll always love and adore Him, It's all because of Blessed Calvary!
