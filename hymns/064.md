## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus waits patiently for me; I'm not all that I should be. He's with me each day, answers when I pray, and bestows everlasting love. Now I praise Him for all that He's done for me, His saving grace sets me free; He suffered and died, now He's glorified, and proclaims everlasting love.

### Verse 2

O Lord, I humbly pray, fill my heart with Your mercy each day; then grace I will know and my life will show Your complete, everlasting love. Now I praise You for all that You've done for me, once I was blind now I see; You emptied Yourself, left Your throne above, and brought me everlasting love; You are love, everlasting love.
