## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe on His gentle breast, there by His love o'ershaded, sweetly my soul shall rest. Hark! Tis the voice of angels, borne in a song to me, over the fields of glory, over the jasper sea.

### Verse 2

Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe from corroding care, safe from the worlds temptations, sin cannot harm me there. Free from the blight of sorrow, free from my doubts and fears, only a few more trials, only a few more tears!

### Verse 3

Jesus, my hearts dear refuge, Jesus has died for me; firm on the rock of ages, ever my trust shall be. Here let me wait with patience, wait til the night is oer; wait til I see the morning break on the golden shore.

### Chorus

Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe on his gentle breast, there by His love oershaded, sweetly my soul shall rest.
