# 21264 - OPEN MY HEART

## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my soul feels empty and time goes on, How deep I hurt within, And then I open the Word of Life, It fills my spirit again.

### Verse 2

There are times when I am alone at heart with burdens hard to bear, And then I cry to my God above, For He will answer my pray'r.

### Verse 3

When my soul is tempted and I give in, O, Lord, I feel ashamed, And then I fall on my knees and cry, "Lord, set me free from this stain!"

### Chorus

Open my heart, Live in my soul, Light up my eyes with a heavenly glow; Lord, cleanse my mind, Fill me, I pray, Open my heart till I meet You some day.
