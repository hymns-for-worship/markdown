## Lyrics

### Verse 5

In the evening time of life, After all the toil and strife, Grant, O Lord, that I may be Resting yet in Thee.

### Verse 1

In this quiet evening time Steals a peace profound, sublime, O'er my spirit as I pray At the end of day.

### Verse 2

Through the tumult of the day Many cares have come my way. Now I gladly, cheerfully, Cast them all on Thee.



### Verse 3

In a thoughtless way have I Wounded someone passing by? Have I overstepped some way? Lord, forgive, I pray.



### Verse 4

Now the night is coming on; Twilight fades, is almost gone. As I slumber, let me be Resting, Lord, in Thee.
