# 1052 - Until Then

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My heart can sing when I pause to remember a heartache here is but a stepping stone. Along a trail that's winding always upward- This troubled world is not my final home.

### Verse 2

The things of earth will dim and lose their value, If we recall, they're borrowed for awhile; And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble, Remembered there, will only bring a smile.

### Verse 3

This weary world with all its toil and struggle May take its toll of misery and strife; The soul of man is like a waiting falcon- When it's released, it's destined for the skies.

### Chorus

But until then my heart will go on singing, Until then with joy I'll carry on- Until the day my eyes behold the city, Until the day God calls me home.
