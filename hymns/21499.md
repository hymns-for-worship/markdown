## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Inside the gates of home, sweet home, No heart is sad, none cares to roam; There life is bright and sweet and fair, And joy supreme is dwelling there.

### Verse 2

Inside the gates the angels bright Abide with Christ who is the light; And there the glad eternal throng Sing all the while the glad new song.

### Verse 3

There tears will all be washed away, And joy will crown the endless day; There glory crowns we all shall wear And mingle with the pure and fair.


### Verse 4

O, comrades, trust redeeming love, That we may meet our King above; And, gathered 'round His throne, adore, Our blessed Lord for evermore.

### Chorus

Inside the gates, the pearly gates, Pure rapture for the faithful waits; My soul no more will sigh or roam, Inside the gates of home, sweet home.
