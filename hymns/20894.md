# 20894 - THE MOUNTAINS OF FAITH

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm seeking the country where Jesus has gone; I'm facing the beauty of heaven's bright dawn; I'm climbing the mountains, the mountains of faith, And now I can see o'er the river of death.

### Verse 2

I've climbed to the summit of holy desire, But onward and upward my soul doth aspire; I see in the sunlight some higher peaks glow, And strong in my Savior, still upward I go.

### Verse 3

I've left all the fogs of the valley behind, And here the bright sunlight forever I find; The clouds are beneath me, above is my home, Â And Christ, my dear Savior, invites me to come.

### Verse 4

I see the fair city where Jesus awaits, I see the bright walls with their wide open'd gates; I'm climbing the mountains, but soon I'll arise, And leave the last peak for my home in the skies.

### Chorus

I'm climbing, climbing, I'm climbing the mountains of faith; Still higher I climb, to regions sublime, On the peaks of the mountains of faith.
