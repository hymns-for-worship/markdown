### Verse 1

Sing, O Sing, O sing unto the Lord, Lift your voice to praise His holy name. Sing, O Sing, O Sing of our salvation, Give to Him the glory due His name.

### Verse 2

Sing, O sing, The song about the Lamb, Give to Him your sacrifice of praise. Sing, O sing, O make a noise so joyful, To our Lord, our voices we do raise.

### Verse 3

Sing, O sing, with all our Lord's redeemed ones, Let us sing the song of victory! Sing, O sing, a song of our thanksgiving, From sin's death our Lord has set us free.

### Verse 4

Sing, O sing, about our home in heaven, O, sweet place of rest is waiting there! Sing, O sing, and praise His name forever, For our robes we will gladly, gladly wear!
