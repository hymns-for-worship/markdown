## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, if my house is built upon a Rock, I know it will stand forever; The floods may come, And the rolling thunder's shock May beat upon my house That is founded on a Rock, But it never will fall, never will fall, Never, never, never.

### Verse 2

For He whose word is lasting as the hills, Whose truth is unchanging ever, Hath said my house On the solid Rock shall stand; He'll hold it by His might In the hollow of His hand, And it never will fall, never will fall, Never, never, never.

### Verse 3

O, if my house is built upon the sand, 'Twill fall when the floods are swelling; The winds will blow, And the tempest will descend And beat upon my house That is built upon the sand, And surely it will fall never to rise, Never, never, never.

### Verse 4

Then let my house be built upon a Rock, For there it will stand forever; The floods may come, And the rolling thunder's shock May beat upon my house That is founded on a Rock, But it never will fall, never will fall, Never, never, never.

### Chorus

My Rock is firm, it is my sure foundation, 'Tis Jesus Christ, my loving Savior, Jesus Christ, my loving Savior, The Rock of my salvation, The Rock of my salvation.
