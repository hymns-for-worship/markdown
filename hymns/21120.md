## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone? Does the road you travel harbor danger yet unknown? Are you growing weary in the struggle of it all? Jesus will help you when on His name you call.

### Verse 2

Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and despair? Does the future press you with its worry and its care? Are you tired and friendless, have you almost lost your way? Jesus will help you, just come to Him today.

### Chorus

He is always there, hearing ev'ry prayer, faithful and true; Walking by our side, in His love we hide all the day thru. When you get discouraged just remember what to do Reach out to Je-sus, He's reaching out to you.
