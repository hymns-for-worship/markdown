# 20320 - GOD'S EMBRACE

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I have a longing within my heart To choose, like Mary, "the better part." I need God's love and His word of grace; I have a longing for His embrace; His embrace.

### Verse 2

 Lost in a barren and thirsty land, I reach in faith for His outstretched hand. God never leaves me, He answers prayer For quiet rest in His righteous care; His righteous care

### Verse 3

My soul's desire is to hear His call, To see my Savior who gave His all; That day my longing, God will replace With endless comfort in His embrace; His embrace.
