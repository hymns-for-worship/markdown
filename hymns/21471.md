## Lyrics

### Verse 1

See the shining dewdrops On the flowers strewed, Proving as they sparkle, God is always good. See the morning sunbeams Lighting up the wood, Silently proclaiming, "God is always good."


### Verse 2

Hear the mountain streamlet In its solitude, With its ripple saying, "God is always good." In the leafy treetops, Where no fears intrude, Merry birds are singing, "God is always good."


### Verse 3

He who came to save us Shed His precious blood; Pow'rfully declaring "God is always good." Bring, my heart, your tribute, Songs of gratitude; All things join to tell us, "God is always good."
