## Notation

C - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As I walk the road of life my feet grow weary, And I stumble thru the throns and shifting sand; But I never have a fear about tomorrow, For I'm led by the Master's hand.

### Verse 2

Thru the valley of despair tho' I may wander, On the highest mountain top I soon shall stand; And I'll never walk alone, for my heart tells me, I'll be led by the Master's hand.

### Chorus

Thru the storm, thru the night I'll keep holding on; With His hand holding mine, hope is never gone. When I climb the last mile to heaven's land, I'll be led by the Master's hand.
