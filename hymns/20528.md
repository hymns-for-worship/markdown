## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hark! 'Tis the Shepherd's voice I hear, Out in the desert dark and drear, Calling the lambs who've gone astray, Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

### Verse 2

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind, Help Him the little lambs to find? Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold, Where they'll be sheltered fro the cold?

### Verse 3

Out in the desert hear their cry, Out on the mountain wild and high; Hark! 'Tis the Master speaks to thee: "Go find my lambs where'er they be."

### Chorus

Bring them in, Bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of sin! Bring them in,  Bring them in, Bring the little ones to Jesus.
