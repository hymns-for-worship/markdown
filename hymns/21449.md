## Lyrics

### Verse 5

When life is o'er, some morning bright and fair, I'll leave these lands; With all the redeemed, a crown to wear, Not made, not made with hands.

### Verse 1

My Savior's gone a mansion to prepare, In yon fair lands; Adorned it will be with jewels rare, Not made, not made with hands.

### Verse 2

How wonderful the story I've been told, That in those lands The gates all are pearl, the streets are gold, Not made, not made with hands.

### Verse 3

Just over there, its splendor I can see, All fair it stands; How wondrous this dwelling place for me, Not made, not made with hands.

### Verse 4

There all the ransom'd robed in spotless white, Dwell in those lands, Securely within that home of light, Not made, not made with hands.

### Chorus

I know, I know, in heav'n for me a mansion stands; A home, a home, Not made with hands.
