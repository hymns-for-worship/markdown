## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Looking out at all Creation With the proof of Him in view, I'm reminded of my Savior Of His pow'r to make things new. When I hear the sparrow singing From the nest up in the tree, I'm reminded of my Savior How He ever cares for me.

### Verse 2

When I walk along the seaside And I look across the waves, I'm reminded of my Savior How He came my soul to save.

### Verse 3

When the grain is ripe for harvest And the grapes are on the vine, I'm reminded of my Savior How He gave His life for mine.

### Verse 4

When I raise my eyes t'ward heaven And I see clouds in the sky, I'm reminded of my Savior How He'll take me home on high, How He'll take me home on high.
