### Verse 1

Lord of all creation, of water, earth and sky; the heavens are Your tabernacle. Glory to the Lord on high. God of wonders beyond our galaxy: You are holy, holy. The universe declares Your majesty. You are holy, holy. Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth;  Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth;  Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth, Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth! Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth!

Early in the moring I will celebrate the light; and when I stumble in the darkness, I will tell Your name by night. Precious Lord You reveal Your majesty; You are holy, holy. The universe declares Your majesty. You are holy, holy. Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth;  Lord of heaven and earth; Lord of heaven and earth;  Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth, Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth! Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth!
