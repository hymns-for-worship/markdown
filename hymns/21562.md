## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption, No riches of earth could have saved my poor soul; The blood of the cross is my only foundation, The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.



### Verse 2

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption, The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown; The blood of the cross is my only foundation, The death of my Savior could only atone.



### Verse 3

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption, the holy commandment forbade me draw near; The blood of the cross is my only foundation, the death of my Savior removeth my fear.

### Verse 4

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption, The way into heaven could not thus be bought; The blood of the cross is my only foundation, the death of my Savior redemption hath wrought.

### Chorus

I am redeemed, but not with silver, I am bought, but not with gold; Bought with a priceâ€” the blood of Jesus, Precious price of love untold.
