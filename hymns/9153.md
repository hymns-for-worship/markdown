## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Father bless  this solemn day, When we assemble sing and pray, To honor Christ, Thine only Son, Who tasted death for ev'ry one.

### Verse 2

In fervant prayers and sacred hymns, We all cry out, "Remember Him," And cry within, "For me He died, For me the Lord was crucified."

### Verse 3

Then as we eat unleavened bread And drink the cup, we bow our heads, And see the suff'ring death of Christ - His blood! His body! Sacrificed!"

### Verse 4

O Father, let us see His death, And feel His grief, disgrace and pain; O let us see His death again.
