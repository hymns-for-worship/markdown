## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, let my faith be like Abraham's, My path, the path he trod, my gifts from Thee, sacrificed as alms, My name, the "Friend of God."

### Verse 2

Like others' faith, Lord, would my faith be, At work in times of fear, Protecting men who would die for Thee On noble missions here.

### Verse 3

Lord, help me be like the patient man, Whose faith could long endure, Though blessed by Thee, tried and blessed again, In all, remaining pure.

### Verse 4

And let my pray'rs, like the faithful pray'rs Of prophets long ago, Call down Thy pow'r, so that ev'rywhere, The cause of Christ will grow.
