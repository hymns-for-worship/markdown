## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus is all the world to me, My life, my joy, my all; He is my strength from day to day, Without Him I would fall; When I am sad, to Him I go, No other one can cheer me so; When I am sad, He makes me glad: He's my Friend.

### Verse 2

 Jesus is all the world to me, My Friend in trials sore; I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er; He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest's golden grain; Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain: He's my Friend.


### Verse 3

 Jesus is all the world to me, And true to Him I'll be; O, how could I this Friend deny, When He's so true to me? Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night;

### Verse 4

 Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend; I trust Him now, I'll trust Him when Life's fleeting days shall end; Beautiful life with such a Friend; Beautiful life that has no end; Eternal life, eternal joy: He's my Friend.
