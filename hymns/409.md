## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord; She is His new creation By water and the word; From heav'n He came and sought her To be His holy bride; With His own blood He bought her,

### Verse 2

 Elect from ev'ry nation, Yet one o'er all the earth; Her charter of salvation: One Lord, one faith, one birth; One holy name she blesses, Partakes one holy food, And to one hope she presses With ev'ry grace endued.

### Verse 3

 Tho' with a scornful wonder We see her sore oppressed, Her doctrine rent asunder, By names and creeds distressed; Yet saints their watch are keeping, They cry: "How long, how long?" And soon the night of weeping Shall be the morn of song.
