### Verse 1

When I look into Your holiness, When I gaze into Your loveliness, When all things that surround become Shadows in the light of You; When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart, When my will becomes entralled in Your love, When all things that surround become Shadows in the light of You,

I worship You, I worship You. The reason I live is to worship You. I worship You, I worship You. The reason I live is to worship You.
