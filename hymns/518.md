## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior, Trying to follow our Savior and King; Shaping our lives by His blessed example, Happy, how happy, the songs that we bring.

### Verse 2

 Pressing more closely to Him who is leading, When we are tempted to turn from the way; Trusting the arm that is strong to defend us, Happy, how happy, our praises each day.

### Verse 3

 Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior, Upward, still upward we'll follow our Guide; When we shall see Him, "the King in His beauty," Happy, how happy, our place at His side. 

### Chorus

How beautiful; to walk in the steps of the Savior, Stepping in the light, stepping in the light; How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior, Led in paths of light.
