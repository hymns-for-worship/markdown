## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God sends springs into the valleys, Flowing softly thro' the hills; God sends streams down from the mountains, Leaping over rocks and rills. He fills rivers, He fills oceans, O! What bounty overflows! But His gift of Living Water Quenches thirst within my soul.

### Verse 2

God makes seed we plant for harvest, Grows the seedling in the field, Ripens grain for us to gather For the good bread it will yield. He made manna sent from heaven, O! What bounty He bestows! Yet the Bread of Life He gives me Feeds the hunger of my soul.

### Verse 3

God provides in great abundance; Of His bounty He has said: "I'll not see the saints forsaken or the righteous begging bread." Father, keep it still before me, Greatest bounty You bestow Is the Christ, the Living Water, Bread of Life to fill my soul.
