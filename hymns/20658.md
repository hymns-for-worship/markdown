## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I love to hear the stories that Jesus taught His friends. His stories help me understand how He wants me to live.

### Verse 2

The kingdom is so special that it is like a pearl. It's also like a treasure that someone's looking for.

### Verse 3

The kingdom's like a supper that you're invited to. Some people choose to stay away, I hope that won't be you.

### Verse 4

The kingdom's like some leaven or a small mustard seed. It starts out very little Then grows up big indeed.
