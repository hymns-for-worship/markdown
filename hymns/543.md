## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Great God of nations, now to Thee Our hymn  of gratitude we raise; With humble heart and bending knee We offer Thee our song of praise. 

### Verse 2

 Here freedom spreads her banner wide And casts  her soft and hallowed ray; Here Thou our fathers' steps didst guide In safety thru their dang'rous way. 

### Verse 3

 We pray Thee let the gospel light Thru all our land its rad'ance shed; Dispel the shades of error's night, And heav'nly blessings round us spread.

### Verse 4

 Great God, pre serve us in Thy fear; In danger still our Guardian be; O spread Thy truth's bright precepts here; Let all the people worship Thee.
