## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O sing a song of Bethleham, Of shepherds watching there, And of the news that came to them From angels in the air. The light that shone on Bethlehem Fills all the world today; Of Jesus' birth and peace on earth The angels sing alway.

### Verse 2

O sing a song of Galilee, Of lake and woods and hill, Of Him who walked upon the sea And bade the waves be still. For though like waves on Galilee, Dark seas of trouble roll, When faith has heard the Master's word, Falls peace upon the soul.

### Verse 3

O sing a song of Calvary, Its glory and dismay, Of Him who hung upon the tree, And took our sins away. For He who died on Calvary Is risen from the grave, And Christ, our Lord, by heav'n adored, Is mighty now to save.
