## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Day by day and with each passing moment, strength I find to meet my trials here; trusting in my father's wise bestowment, I've no cause for worry or for fear. He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure gives unto each day what he deems best. Lovingly, it's part of pain and pleasure, mingling toil and peace and rest.

### Verse 2

Everyday the lord himself is near me with a special mercy for each hour; all my cares he fain would bear, and chear me, he whose name is counsellor and power. The protection of his child and treasure is a charge that on himself he laid; "as your days your strength shall be in measure," this the pledge to me he made.

### Verse 3

Help me then in every tribulation so to trust thy promises, o Lord, that I lose not faith's sweet consolation offered me within thy holy word. Help me , Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, e'er to take as from a father's hand, one by one the days, the moments fleeting, till I reach the promised land.
