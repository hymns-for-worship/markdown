## Lyrics

### Verse 1

High above the seraphim Sounds an everlasting hymn; Voices echo thru the hall And shake the temple wall. Living creatures bless the King Four and twenty elders sing, "Worthy, He Who overcame;" "The Word of God" His name.

### Verse 2

Praise the Seed of Abraham! All dominion to the Lamb! Sing of Him, in glory slain, "Lord God Almighty reigns!" Shout the God-breathed prophecy: "He who was will every be!" "Kings of earth have passed away!" The Son is Lord this day!

### Verse 3

Night to night I come to Him, Kneel before His diadem; While a thousand thousand sing, I fall before the King. Soon will He be changing me, Clothed in immortality, Swallowed up in victory, And evermore to be.
