## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The arm of the Lord is revealed By Him our souls are sealed; He has borne our disgrace and shame, And Jesus is His name. The pow'rful arm of the Lord, Delivers from death's strong cord, That once held us enslaved to sin With no victory to win.

### Verse 2

All earth yields unto our great Lord, Jesus our shield and sword; He leads us in battle from fear, For heaven's hope is near. Our hearts yearn for the Lord's arm; To keep us from sin's great harm; And oft it leads thru lowly ways, His great arm forever stays.
