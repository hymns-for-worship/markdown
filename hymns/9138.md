## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O God of earth and firmament, we are Thy holy nation, The servants of Thy covenant, the heirs of Thy salvation, Released from bonds of sin, and free, Reborn and dead to enmity, A sacifice we bring to Thee: This hymn of exultation.

### Verse 2

We thank Thee for the gift of life of which we have partaken, For peace beyond the reach of strife, for hope that stands unshaken. Through trouble, sorrow, and despair, We trust Thee, Rock of answered prayer, For we are children of Thy care and cannot be forsaken.

### Verse 3

We do not fear that even death could hinder Thine endeavor; The bindings of Thy solemn oath, no life nor death can sever. And by Thy promise we shall be reclothed in immortality, Thy people through eternity, with Thou, our joy forever.
