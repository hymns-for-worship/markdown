## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the wilderness, wand'ring, I was swallowed by night. Ev'ry step made me stumble. I was walking by sight. With no map to direct me, Nor a compass to guide, I fled on thru the darkness, Led along by my pride.

### Verse 2

Then I heard of one crying, "Make the paths straight for Him," He declared God's salvation. He said, "Follow the Lamb!" And a voice came from heaven: "I am please in My Son," As the Spirit descended On the beloved One.

### Verse 3

Then upon the horizon Rose a bright morning star. Faith illumined my pathway And the word pierced my heart. Then I wept for transgressions But His mercy shone out Driving out all the darkness, All my guilt and my doubt.

### Verse 4

Thru the valley of shadow, In the presence of foes, Nevermore will I tremble At their threats or my woes. Perfect love is within me, Casting out fear and night. For, by faith, I am walking As a child of the light.
