## Notation

A - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, peaceful quiet of dawn, O gentle pinks and blues. This is the time I cherish, While watching heav'nly hues.

### Verse 2

I feel the morning breeze, The dew on lawn and rose; And hear the  breath of children, Who dream in sweet repose.

### Verse 3

The chirping of the frog, The cricket's fading song, Will sing to all who listen, "The morn will not be long."

### Verse 4

The birds' soft songs of morn, The moments passing by; The peaceful rest of morning, Gives way to one more day.

### Chorus

And God has made another day, Gently sustaining me. His Loving Breath shall guide thru the day, Giving me calmness and peace.
