## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where cross the crowded ways of life, Where sound the cries of race and clan A-bove the noise of selfish strife, We hear Your voice, O Son of Man.

### Verse 2

In haunts of wretchedness and need, On shadowed thresholds dark with fears, From paths where hide the lures of greed, We catch the vision of Your tears.

### Verse 3

The cup of water giv'n for You, Still holds the freshness of Your grace; Yet long these multitudes to view The sweet compasion of Your face.

### Verse 4

O Master, from the mountainside Make haste to heal these hearts of pain; Among these restless throngs abide; O tread the city's streets again.
