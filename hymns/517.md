## Lyrics

### Verse 3

 O, quiet joy from knowing God; A precious inner peace, Reveals eternal glory, Where joy will never cease. 

### Verse 1

 O joy that soars above my ways, In ev'ry song of praise. Borne high with rev'rent awe,  To touch the hem of God. 

### Verse 2

 My joy springs from humility, It's held secure in trust. My joy grows strong in suff'ring, It's kept in thankfulness.
