## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Made lower than the angels were, And fashioned like a man; Christ Jesus came to save my soul, And gave the perfect plan. The Lord of glory paid my debt, And suffered in my place; Now I can be a soul redeemed; He saved me by His grace.

### Verse 2

Lord, now I come believing You, Tho' I am dead in sin; So bury me like in Your death, And raise me up again. Lord, now I come believing You As I walk in Your light. Your cleansing blood will save my soul, And wash me all my life.

### Verse 3

My Savior won my victory, And gives eternal life; Supreme example is for me In ev'ry mortal strife. Lord, now I come believing You As I walk in Your light. Your cleansing blood will save my soul, And wash me all my life.
