## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He that gives the flowers splendor, He that gives the sparrow song. He that lets me see and listen, Keeps me singing all day long.

### Verse 2

He that sends the cooling showers, Sends a rainbow 'cross the sky. Sends the moon aglow with wonder, Gives me joy enough to cry. 

### Verse 3

Gladness fills my very being, Just to feel and breathe and live. Just to know 'tis but my Father, That may ev'ry blessing give.

### Chorus

Wanting not for mortal reason, nor to wonder how or why. Just to glance toward Thee in heaven, Lord, my faith could never die.
