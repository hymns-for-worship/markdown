## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once I lived my life each day as if I was not astray, And then I heard the Truth so sweetly say, Jesus died in agony that my soul could be set free. Now I'm saved, Lord, never leave, Hold my hand.

### Verse 2

As I struggle thru this life, Lord, please help me win the fight, I'll pray for hope and strength from up above; When temptation comes my way, I will lift my eyes and say, "Lord, please help me build my faith," Hold my hand.

### Verse 3

When this earthly life is o'er, I will rest upon that shore and sing with all the saints for evermore; I will live with God above as I dwell within His love, Lord, until my days are done, Hold my hand.
