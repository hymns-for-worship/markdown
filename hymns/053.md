Christ, the Lord, is ris'n today, Hallelujah! Sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah! Raise your joys and triumphs high Hallelujah! Sing, ye heav'ns and earth, reply, Hallelujah!

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Hallelujah! Christ hath burst the gates of hell, Hallelujah! Death in vain forbids His rise, Hallelujah! Christ hath opened paradise, Hallelujah!
