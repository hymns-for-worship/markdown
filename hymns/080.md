## Notation

F - 3/2 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father, hear the prayer we offer: nor for ease that prayer shall be, but for strength, that we may ever live our lives courageously.

### Verse 2

Not forever by still waters would we idly, quiet stay; but would smite the living fountains from the rocks along the way.

### Verse 3

Be our strength in hours of weakness, in our wandrings be our guide; thro endeavor, failure, danger, Father, be Thou at our side.

### Verse 4

Let our path be bright or dreary, storm or sunshine be our share; may our souls in hope unweary make Thy work our ceaseless prayer. 

### Coda

Amen.
