# 20896 - WE'LL NEVER SAY GOODBYE

## Notation

Bb - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With friends on earth we meet in gladness, While swift the moments fly, Yea, ever comes the tho't of sadness, That we must say goodbye.

### Verse 2

How joyful is the hope that lingers, When saved ones cross death's sea, That we, when all earth's toils are ended, With them shall ever be.

### Verse 3

No parting words shall e'er be spoken In yonder home so fair, But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness, We'll sing forever there.

### Chorus

We'll never say goodbye in heav'n, We'll never say goodbye; For in that land of joy and song, We'll never say goodbye.
