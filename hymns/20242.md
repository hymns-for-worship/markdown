## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I was alone until one day, I read God's word and found the way. Christ lived and died to save my soul, and now in Him my life is whole. 

### Verse 2

O blessed hope God gave to me; His Son arose triumphantly. I have His word to guide me on until one day He calls me home.

### Verse 3

I have this hope. You need it too.  God gave to me, He'll give to you.  Have faith in God to be your guide.  He'll take you home if you'll abide. 

### Chorus

I have a hope, It is with God.  I have a hope. It is with God. I'll trust in Him, thru all my trials, Till comes the day He calls me home.
