## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are a tapestry of love, And we are woven together in the pattern from above. We are proclaiming His wisdom, The insight of His plan. There is no wrinkle, no spot, It is the glory of His Hand. 

### Verse 2

Each one in Christ is interlaced. He makes us holy and blameless thru the riches of His grace, For He has washed us, and cleansed us thru Jesus Christ His Son; and used the shuttle of truth to bind our hearts and make us one.

### Chorus

Intertwined and is strengthened by the others; truth aligned, we are fashioned to His beauty; helping, serving for the good  of each other;  Woven with hope, Woven with joy, lavished with the glory of His wond'rous grace.
