## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me, All His wonderful passion and purity; May His Spirit divine all my being refine, Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me.

### Verse 2

 When somebody has been so unkind to you, Some word spoken that pierces you thru and thru, Think how He was beguiled, spat upon and reviled, Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in you.

### Verse 3

 From the dawn of the morning to close of day, In example in deeds and in all you say; Lay your gifts at His feet, ever strive to keep sweet, Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in you.
