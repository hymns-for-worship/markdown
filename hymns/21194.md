## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come unto Me, you weary, And I will give you rest. O blessed voice of Jesus, That comes to hearts oppressed! He tells of benediction, Of pardon, grace, and peace, Of joy that has no ending, Of love that cannot cease.

### Verse 2

Come unto Me, you wand'rers, And I will give you light. O loving voice of Jesus, That comes to cheer the night! Our hearts were filled with sadness, And we had lost our way; But He has bro't us gladness And songs at break of day.

### Verse 3

Come unto Me, you fainting, And I will give you life. O cheering voice of Jesus, That comes to aid our strife! The foe is stern and eager, The fight is fierce and long; But He has made us mighty And stronger than the strong.

### Verse 4

"And whosoever cometh, I will not cast him out." O welcome voice of Jesus, That drives away our doubt, He calls us, very sinners, Unworthy tho' we be, And offers lovingkindness And life abundantly.
