## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Far and near the fields are teeming With the waves of ripened grain; Far and near their gold is gleaming O'er the sunny slope and plain. 

### Verse 2

 Send them forth with morn's first beaming, Send them in the noontide's glare; When the sun's last rays are gleaming, Bid them gather ev'rywhere. Lord of harvest,

### Verse 3

 O thou, whom thy Lord is sending, Gather now the sheaves of gold; Heav'nward then at evening wending, Thou shalt come with joy untold. 

### Chorus

Lord of harvest, send forth reapers! Hear us, Lord, to Thee we cry, Send them now the sheaves to gather, Ere the harvesttime pass by.
