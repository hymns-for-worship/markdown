## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ho! my comrades, see the signal, Waving in the sky! Reinforcements now appearing, Victory is nigh!

### Verse 2

See the mighty host advancing, Satan leading on; Mighty men around us falling, Courage almost gone.

### Verse 3

See the glorious banner waving, Hear the bugle blow; In our Leader’s Name we triumph Over every foe.

### Verse 4

Fierce and long the battle rages, But our help is near; Onward comes our great Commander, Cheer, my comrades, cheer! 

### Chorus

“Hold the fort, for I am coming,” Jesus signals still, Wave the answer back to Heaven, “By Thy grace we will.”
