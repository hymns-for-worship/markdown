## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As we partake of the supper of Jesus, May we believe that He died on that tree. He gave His life that we might have forgiveness. He paid the price upon Mount Calvary. 

### Verse 2

 The Son of God came to earth to bring freedom. He saw us chained in the bondage of sin. We had no hope unless He would save us. He is our King, Redeemer and our Friend.
