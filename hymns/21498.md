## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When days of toil have all gone by, And I my dear Lord shall see, A word of welcome when we shall meet I know will make heav'n for me.

### Verse 2

The Father's house, the mansions fair, My home shall for ever be; But one sweet word from the Lord I love I know will make heaven for me.


### Verse 3

He saved me from my lost estate, From sin He has set me free, And just to see Him when He shall come I know will be heaven for me.

### Chorus

Heaven for me, O, it will be! When Jesus whispers a welcome to me; When Jesus whispers a welcome to me. Heaven for me, O, it will be! When Jesus whispers a welcome to me;  When Jesus gives a welcome to me, a smile and a welcome to me.
