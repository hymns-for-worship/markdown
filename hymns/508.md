## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 To the work! to the work! we are servants of God, Let us follow the path that our Master has trod; With the balm of His counsel our strength to renew, Let us do with our might what our hands find to do. 

### Verse 2

 To the work! to the work! let the hungry be fed; To the fountain of Life let the weary be led; In the cross and its banner our glory shall be, While we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free!"

### Verse 3

 To the work! to the work! in the strength of the Lord, And a robe and a crown shall our labor reward; When the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be, And we shout with the ransomed, "Salvation is free!" 

### Chorus

Toiling on, toiling on, Toiling on, toiling on, Let us hope, let us watch, And labor till the Master comes.
