## Notation

Ab - 6/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Would you be freed from your burden of sin? Hear the sweet whisper of pardon within? Would you this moment a new life begin, this is the only way.

### Verse 2

Would you have light that no clouds can obscure? Would you have joys that are fadeless and pure? Would you have help that is mighty and sure? This is the only way.

### Verse 3

Would you find rest in a blessed retreat? Rest undisturbed by the tempest that beat? Would you be ready the judgement to meet? This is the only way.

### Chorus

Come to the cross of the son of God, trust in the power of his saving blood, walk in the path where his feet once trod, this is the only way.
