## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, Pilgrim thru this barren land; I am weak, but Thou art mighty, Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand; Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more. Feed me till I want no more.

### Verse 2

Open now the crystal fountain, Whence the healing waters flow; Let the fire and cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey thru; Strong Deliv'rer, Strong Deliv'rer, Be Thou still my strength and shield, Be Thou still my strength and shield.

### Verse 3

When I tread the verge of Jordan, Bid my anxious fears subside; Bear me thru the swelling current, Land me safe on Canaan's side; Songs of praises, Songs of praises I will ever give to Thee, I will ever give to Thee.
