### Verse 1

Teach me, O Lord, to love Thee still, Fully obedient to Thy will. Living in hope and joy in Thee, Knowing that Thou still lovest me.

Troubles may come and trials sore, Sorrows more deep than e'er before. Still I will put my trust in Thee, Knowing that Thou still lovest me.

### Verse 3

Should I receive prosperity, Pleasures and joys abundantly; May I still give glad praise to Thee, Knowing that Thou still lovest me.

### Verse 4

When in eternity I stand, Judgment receive from Thy own hand, This will my sweet assurance be, Knowing that Thou hast loved me.

Then with the angels let me sing, With Thy dear saints make anthems ring. Joy in the endless victory, Knowing that Thou still lovest me.

Lovest me so graciously! How blest is my soul! Thou lovest me still!
