## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, our Lord and King, To You our praises rise; To You our bodies we present, A living sacrifice.

### Verse 2

Now justified by grace And made alive to God, Formed for Yourself to show Your praise, We sound Your love abroad.

### Verse 3

As dead indeed to sin, We rise to walk anew, Henceforth, as not our own, but Yours, We follow only You.

### Verse 4

Baptized into Your death, With You again we rise, To newness of a life of faith, To new and endless joys.
