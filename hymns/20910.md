## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come ye sinners, poor and needy, weak and wounded, sick and sore; Jesus ready stands to save you, full of pity, love, and pow'r.

### Verse 2

Come ye thirsty, come and welcome, God's free bounty glorify; True belief and true repentance, ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.

### Verse 3

Come ye weary, heavy laden, bruised and broken, full of sin; If you tarry till you're better, you may never enter in.

### Verse 4

View Him prostrate in the garden, on the ground your Maker lies; On the bloody tree behold Him, sinner will not this suffice?

### Verse 5

Lo! th'incarnate God ascended, pleads the merit of His blood; Venture on Him, venture wholly, let no other trust intrude.

### Chorus

I will arise and go to Jesus, He will embrace me in His arms; In the arms of my dear Savior, O there are ten thousand charms.
