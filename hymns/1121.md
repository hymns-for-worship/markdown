# 1121 - Where Once There Were Tears

## Notation

D - 6/4 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We've seen so much sadness when loved ones go on. We've seen so much crying and felt all alone. We've seen even hunger when souls do without. We've known disappointment, And often known doubt.

### Verse 2

But one day all sadness will fade on the lee, To make room for gladness for you and for me, When all of our troubles and trials of the road, Are gone as a vapor, In yonder abode.

### Verse 3

And soon the fair morning will glow all around, Without the fair sunlight up there shining down. And sure, there'll be shouting when Jesus appears, And sure, there'll be gladness where once there were tears.
