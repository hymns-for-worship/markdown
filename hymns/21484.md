## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sound aloud the trumpet! Loud the anthem raise! Lift your joyful voices In a song of praise. Death has been defeated; By the True and Brave. For the Lord is risen; Risen from the grave.



### Verse 2

Sad had been the faces; Dark had been the night, When the Lord was buried; Buried out of sight. But the sorr'wing count'nance Of the faithful few Turned to glad rejoicing When they heard the news.


### Verse 3

Dark may be the midnight Of your troubled soul As you struggle onward Pressing t'ward the goal. Lift your face to calv'ry And the empty tomb; Let the joyful tidings Take away your gloom.

### Chorus

Glory, Hallelujah! To the Son of Man. Great has been the vict'ry Over death and sin. Lift Him up in triumph; Worship at His feet. For the Lord is risen; He is ris'n indeed.
