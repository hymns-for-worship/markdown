### Verse 1

In heavenly armor we'll enter the land, The battle belongs to the Lord. No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand, The battle belongs to the Lord.

### Verse 2

When the power of darkness comes in like a flood, The battle belongs to the Lord. He's raised up a standard the pow'r of his blood, The battle belongs to the Lord.

### Verse 3

When your enemy presses in hard, do not fear, The battle belongs to the Lord. Take courage my friend, Your redemption is near, The battle belongs to the Lord.
