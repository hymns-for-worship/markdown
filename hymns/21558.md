### Verse 1

Regal robe, golden sash; hair so white with eyes like fire. Feet like bronze, glowing bright; voice so pure and filled with pow'r.




### Verse 2

Seven lampstands, seven stars; from His mouth a twoedged sword. Face is shining like the sun; Sov'reign King and Mighty Lord.

### Chorus

Son of Man, Son of Man, I fall at the feet of the Son of Man. He lifts me up and He helps me stand in the holy presence of the Son of Man; in the dazzling presence of the Son of Man.
