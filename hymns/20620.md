# 20620 - WON'T YOU COME

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Do you think when you turn from your Savior, How little He asks you to do? Just to come and confess and obey Him After all He has given to you.

### Verse 2

How He grieves o'er your hardness and sin? How long at your heart He's been knocking, And yet you will not let Him in.

### Verse 3

How He poured out His lifeblood for you? O, the story most wondrous and touching, And you know that the story is true!

### Verse 4

Let me ask, have you counted the cost? Tho' you gain all of earth's fleeting treasure, If your soul in the end should be lost!

### Chorus

Won't you come? Won't you come? Won't you come and confess and obey? The time is so short for His service, and no time is yours but today!
