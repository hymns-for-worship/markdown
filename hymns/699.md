## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As I come to offer worship, True devotion to my God; Brother, will you now forgive me, Aught against me in your heart?

### Verse 2

 Bitter feelings always hinder The sweet fellowship divine. We're no longer parted by them, Now we worship with one mind. 

### Verse 3

 We are sharing now together, Precious kinship in our Lord. May our care be true and tender, In the harmony of love. 

### Chorus

Let us then as one adore Him, Give the Lord our ardent praise. Brother, will you please forgive me, As our voices now we raise.
