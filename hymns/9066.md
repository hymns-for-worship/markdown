## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If love is all I have, Then let me do my part, To share the grief of others and to mend the broken heart. Forbid that I ignore them o rwould keep myself apart, If love is all I have, my love I give.

### Verse 2

If wealth is all I have, Then let me spend it well, In holding up the hands of those who rescue men from hell. What greater puchase could I make than see their numbers swell? If wealth is all I have, my wealth I give.

### Verse 3

If care is all I have, Then help me, learning how, To ease the pain of others, and to wipe the fever'd brow. Lord, help me do it tenderly, and help me do it now. If care is all I have, my care I give.

### Verse 4

If self is all I have, Then let me servant be, Like Him who reigns in glory served with all humility. For only serving others am I truly serving Thee. If self is all I have, my self I give.
