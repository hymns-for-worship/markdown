## Lyrics

### Verse 1

They crucified my Lord, Laid Him in the tomb, Now lies the Son of God in death's sable gloom. The Man of grief and toil There in silence lies; Death has within its coil God of earth and skies. Hallelujah sing, with hearts to heav'n and voices raise, Ever shout, ye ransomed ones, for you His blood was shed; Sing a hymn of gladness , sing to God a hymn of praise, Christ the Lord is ris'n indeed is risen from the dead. He who for the world's salvation bled, Now is risen, risen from the dead, Glory, honor we will ever sing, Praise to our risen King.
