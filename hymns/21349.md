## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Footprints of Jesus to Bethany led, on through Judea to loved ones ahead, Laz'rus, His good friend had yielded to death; Mary and Martha had laid him to rest. Hushed were the guests as they murmured about, but then taken with wonder to hear Jesus shout. 

### Verse 2

Precious old story of Jesus that day, reaching the tomb where His friend, Laz'rus lay; Touched by His loved ones, so smitten with grief; Then, overtaken, He started to weep. Crying and mourning, they saw Jesus pray, but the crowd had no warning for what He would say.

### Chorus

He cried, "Come forth, Lazarus!" The power of God there to make manifest; He cried, "Come forth, Lazarus!" And one who had slept was now raised from the dead!
