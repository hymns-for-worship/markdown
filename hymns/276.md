## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Would you be free from the burden of sin? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; would you over evil a victory win? There's wonderful power in the blood.

### Verse 2

Would you be free from your passion and pride? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; come for a cleansing to calvary's tide, there's wonderful power in the blood.

### Verse 3

Would you do service for Jesus your King? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; would you live daily his praises to sing? There's wonderful power in the blood.

### Chorus

There is power, there is power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb; there is power, there is power, wonder working power in the precious blood of the lamb.
