# 20834 - HIS FOR ETERNITY

## Notation

Db - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just a slave on the auction block of sin, I was serving Satan's purpose but then: Jesus made the sacrifice, fully paid sin's awful price, Brought my ransom on the old rugged cross.

### Verse 2

Now as clay on the Potter's wheel each day, Being molded by the Master His way; I am trying to be still while conforming to His will And I'm learning what it means to be His.

### Chorus

No longer a slave, I've been loosed from my chains, And now I can sing, "I'm free! I'm free!" He's my father, I'm His son; praise the Lord, the work is done! And I'm His for eternity.
