## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness, opened my eyes, let me see, beauty that made this heart adore You, hope of a life spent with You.

### Verse 2

King of all days, all so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above, humbly You came to the earth You created, all for our sake became poor.

### Chorus

Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that You're my God. You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me. And I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon the cross!

### Coda

Beauty that made this heart adore you, hope of a life spent with you.
