## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm not ashamed to own my Lord, Nor to defend His cause, Maintain the honor of His word, The glory of His cross.



















I'm not ashamed to own my Lord, Nor to defend His cause; Maintian the honors of His word, The glory of His cross.

### Verse 2

His consecrated cross I'll bear Till death shall set me free, And then go home, my crown to wear; For there's a crown for me.

### Verse 3

I know not when my Lord may comeâ€” At night or noonday fair, Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him Or "meet Him in the air."

### Verse 4

I know that over yonder stands A place prepared for me, A home, "a house not made with hands," Most wonderful to see.

### Verse 5

Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely follow me, And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be.

### Verse 6

There I shall bathe my weary soul In seas of heav'nly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll, Across my peaceful breast.
