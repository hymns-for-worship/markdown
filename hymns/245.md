## Lyrics

### Verse 1

To canaan's land I'm on my way where the soul never dies; my darkest night will turn to day, where the soul never dies.

### Verse 2

A rose is blooming there for me, where the soul never dies; and I will spend eternity, where the soul never dies.

### Verse 3

A lovelight beams across the foam, where the soul of man never dies; it shines to light the shores of home, where the soul of man never dies.

### Verse 4

I'm on my way to that fair land where the soul never dies; where there will be no parting hand, and the soul never dies.

### Chorus

Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells, there'll be no teardimmed eyes, where all is peace and joy and love and the soul of man never dies.
