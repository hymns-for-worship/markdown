## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a city given To those who please the Lord; Jerusalem from heaven, Their triumph and reward. No unclean thing may enter; No wickedness, come in, For God is at its center, Too pure for any sin. 

### Verse 2

There is a crystal river, Abundant as His grace; It flows with life forever To bless His dwelling place. It fills the saints with gladness Thru that eternal day; They know no pain or sadness, For those have passed away. 

### Verse 3

There is a throne inside it, Of God and of the Lamb; The holy serve beside it And wear the name, "I AM." With God their only temple, They worship and adore, And as His chosen people, They reign forevermore.
