## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How deep the Father's love for us! How vast beyond all measure! That He should give His only Son to make a wretch His treasure! How great the pain of searing loss! The Father turns His face away As wounds which are the Chosen One bring many sons to glory.

### Verse 2

Behold the Man upon the cross, My sin upon His shoulders; Ashamed I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers. It was my sin that held Him there Until it was accomplished. His dying breath has bro't me life; I know that it is finished.

### Verse 3

I will not boast in anything: No gifts, no pow'r, no wisdom; But I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection. Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart His wounds have paid my ransom.
