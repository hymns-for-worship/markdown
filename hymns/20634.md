## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, draw me ever nearer, As I labor thru the storm. You have called me to this passage, And I'll follow, tho' I'm worn.

### Verse 2

Jesus, guide me thru the tempest; Keep my spirit staid and sure. When the midnight meets the morning, Let me love You even more.

### Verse 3

Let the treasures of the trial Form within me as I go, At the end of this long passage, Let me leave them at Your throne.

### Chorus

May this journey bring a blessing; May I rise on wings of faith; At the end of my heart's testing, With Your likeness let me wake.
