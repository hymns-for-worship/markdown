## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With vivid strokes of Majesty, God brushed a work of art, A world to show His Deity And touch the human heart. 



### Verse 2

With splendid tones and perfect keys, God's  music is so clear, For birds and waves and rustling trees Give song to soothe man's ear. 



### Verse 3

With holy words and seeds of life A garden He creates; In morning dew and heaven's light, God's beauty there awaits. 



### Verse 4

With soil and stone and mighty hand God forged an earthly plan, With valleys, plains and mountains grand A home to shelter man.

### Chorus

God's wonderful works declare His name; They form at His command. His power let the world proclaim Too great to understand.
