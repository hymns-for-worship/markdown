## Notation

Ab - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where charity and love prevail, There God is ever found; Bro't here together by Christ's love, By love are we thus bound.

### Verse 2

With grateful joy and holy fear His charity we learn; Let us with heart and mind and soul Now love Him in return.

### Verse 3

Forgive we now each other's faults As we our faults confess, And let us love each other well In Christian holiness.

### Verse 4

Let strife among us be unknown; Let all contention cease; Be His the glory that we see; Be ours His holy peace.

### Verse 5

Let us recall that in our midst Dwells God's begotten Son; As members of His body joined, We are in Him made one.
