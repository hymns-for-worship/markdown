# 341 - The Way Of The Cross Leads Home

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I must needs go home by the way of the cross, there's no other way but this, I shall ne'er get sight of the gates of light if the way of the cross I miss.

### Verse 2

I must needs go on in the bloodsprinkled way, the path that the savior trod, if I ever climb to the heights sublime, where the soul is at home with God.

### Verse 3

Then I bid farewell to the way of the world, to walk in it never more, for my lord says came, and I seek my home, where he waits at the opened door.

### Chorus

The way of the cross leads home, the way of the cross leads home, It is sweet to know as I onward go, the way of the cross leads home.
