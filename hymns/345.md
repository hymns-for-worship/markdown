# 345 - Room At The Cross For You

## Notation

G - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The cross upon which Jesus died is a shelter in which we can hide, and its grace so free is sufficient for me, and deep is its fountain as wide as the sea.

### Verse 2

Tho millions have found him a friend and have turned from the sins they have sinned, the savior still waits to open the gates and welcome a sinner before its too late.

### Verse 3

The hand of my savior is stong, and the love of my savior is long; thru sunshine and rain, thru loss or in gain, the blood flows from calvary to cleanse every stain.

### Chorus

There's room at the cross for you, there's room at the cross for you; tho millions have come, there's still room for one yes, there's room at the cross for you.
