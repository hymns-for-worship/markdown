## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As oft as I beseech Thee, that, Lord, You'd know my name, How can I but remember, my fears and all my shame? My conscience says look downward, lest God would see my face; but Lord, I know You see me; You see my soul's disgrace.

### Verse 2

I seek Thy love to borrow, I seek Thy gracious hand, Tomorrow and tomorrow, reach out and help me stand. Reach out, O Lord and touch me, e'en touch me in my soul, And when Thy grace, I'm feeling, I'll see Thy love unfold.

### Verse 3

O Father, O my Father, let me not ever fear, Let me, with never doubting, know that  my Lord is near. Before Thy seat of mercy, when I bow down in prayer, And feel Thy nearness 'round me, My Lord, I know You care.
