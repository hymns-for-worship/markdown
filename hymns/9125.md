# 9125 - Favor In His Eyes

## Notation

Ab - 3/4 on 2+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I do not care for others' praise, But only let me walk with God, That when I see Him face to face I may find favor in His eyes.

### Verse 2

No finer goal can mortals have Than pleasing Him who made us so. No better ending to a life Than serving 'til it's time to go.

### Verse 3

We do not merit heaven's grace. He does not owe us mercy's part, But when we see Him face to face, Eternal praise will fill our heart.

### Chorus

No fame or fortune can fulfill. No human glory satisfies. I'll serve my Lord 'til time stands still, And then have favor in His eyes.
