## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The kIng of love my shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never, I nothing lack if I am His, And He is mne forever.

### Verse 2

Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul He leadeth, And where the verdant pastures grow, With food celestial feedeth.

### Verse 3

Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed, But yet in love He sought me And on His shoulder gently laid, And home, rejoicing, brought me.

### Verse 4

In death's dark vale I fear no ill With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; Thy rod and staff my comfort still, Thy Cross before to guide me.

### Verse 5

Thou spread'st a table in my sight; Thy unction grace bestoweth; And O, what transport and delight From Thy pure chalice floweth!

### Verse 6

And so through all the length of days Thy goodness faileth never; Good Shepherd! May I sing Thy praise Within Thy house forever.
