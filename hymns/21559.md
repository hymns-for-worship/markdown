## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, in Your wisdom You gave us someone, someone to hold us thru the long, lonely nights. Someone to laugh at the silliest things, someone to lovingly call out our names. 

### Verse 2

Lord, thru Your mercy You gave us someone, someone to notice ev'ry tear that was cried. Someone to magic'ly make things alright, someone to read us sweet stories at night. 


### Chorus

But, most of all Father, we thank You for mothers who pray for their children ev'ry day.
