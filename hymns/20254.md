## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As the sun rises in the east, He shall split the eastern sky. Sword in hand upon the mountain, fire of heaven in His eyes. And ev'ry knee shall bow, ev'ry knee shall bow. We kneel before Him now, and ev'ry knee shall shall bow. 

### Verse 2

Come the dawn of the Prince of Peace, like the morning after rain; There shall be no more of hatred, neither sorrow, neither pain. And ev'ry knee shall bow, ev'ry knee shall bow. We kneel before Him now, and ev'ry knee shall shall bow.
