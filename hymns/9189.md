## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I get to heaven, I hope to see the faces of those that I love, Who taught and exhorted and guided me, To that fair home above.

### Verse 2

When I get to heaven, I'll seek a Friend, both patient and faithful to me. And 'though I failed often to be His friend, The truest Friend was He.

### Verse 3

When I get to heaven, I'll look for you, and hope you'll be looking for me. We'll join with the saints who have gone before, And saints who yet will be.

### Chorus

When I reach my heavenly home, When I get to heaven some day, A glorious reunion awaits, on that grand and happy day.
