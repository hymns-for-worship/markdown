## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beautiful valley of Eden! Sweet is thy noontide calm; Over the hearts of the weary, Breathing thy waves of balm.

### Verse 2

Over the heart of the mourner Shineth thy golden day, Wafting the songs of the angels Down from the far away.

### Verse 3

There is the home of my Savior; There, with the bloodwashed throng, Over the highlands of glory Rolleth the great new song.

### Chorus

Beautiful valley of Eden, Home of the pure and blest, How often amid the wild billows I dream of thy rest, sweet rest!
