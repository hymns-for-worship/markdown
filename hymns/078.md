# 078 - My God, My Father, Though I Stray

## Notation

D - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My God, my Father, tho' I stray far from my home, on life's rough way, o teach me from my heart to say, "Thy will be done!"

### Verse 2

Tho' dark my path, and sad my lot, let me be still and murmur not, or breathe the prayer divinely taught, "Thy will be done!"

### Verse 3

Renew my will from day to day; blend it with Thine, and take away, all that now takes it hard to say, "Thy will be done!"

### Verse 4

Then, when on earth I breathe no more the prayer oft mixed with tears before, I'll sing upon a happier shore, "Thy will be done!" 

### Coda

Amen.
