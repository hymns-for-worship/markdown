### Verse 1

 O Lord, help me maintain An understanding heart, So I can overcome the pain, When those I love depart. 

### Verse 2

 Lord, help me understand That loved ones move away, But carry into future lands, Thy word, learned yesterday. 

### Verse 3

 Help me remember, Lord, When loved ones fall in sin, With kindness, they can be restored, And feel Thy love again.
