## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Under His wings I am safely abiding; Tho the night deepens and tempests are wild, Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me; He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

### Verse 2

 Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow! How the heart yearningly turns to His rest! Often when earth has no balm for my healing, There I find comfort, and there I am blest. Under His wings,

### Verse 3

 Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment! There will I hide till life's trials are o'er; Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me; Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore. 

### Chorus

Under His wings, Who from His love can sever? Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide forever.
