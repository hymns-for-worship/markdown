## Lyrics

### Verse 1

More about Jesus would I know, More of His grace to others show; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.

### Verse 2

 More about Jesus let me learn, More of His holy will discern; Spirit of God my teacher be, Showing the things of Christ to me.

### Verse 3

More about Jesus in His word, Holding communion with my Lord; Hearing His voice in ev'ry line, Making each faithful saying mine. 

### Verse 4

 More about Jesus on His throne, Riches in glory all His own; More of His kingdom's sure increase; More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

### Chorus

More, more about Jesus, More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.
