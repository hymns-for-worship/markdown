## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sometime when misgivings darken the day, And faith's light I cannot see; I ask my dear Lord, to brighten the way, He whispers sweet peace to me.

### Verse 2

I could not go on without Him, I know, the world, would o'erwhelm my soul; His word is a lamp and brightens the way, It points to the heav'nly goal.

### Verse 3

I trust Him thru faith, by faith hold His hand, By faith I will travel on; I'll trust in His word, obey His commands, Till vic'ry I shall have won.

### Verse 4

He speaks thru His word, assurance He gives, I'm His and I know He's mine; and safe in the fold my soul He will keep, I'll rest in His love divine.

### Chorus

He whispers sweet peace to me, He whispers sweet peace to me, And thru His blest word He strenthens my soul, He whispers sweet peace to me.
