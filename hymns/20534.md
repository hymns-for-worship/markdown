## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Jesus knows when I am lonely, He knows each pain, He sees each tear, He understands each lonely heartache, He understands because He cares.

### Verse 2

My Jesus knows when I am burdened, He knows how much my heart can bear; He lifts me up when I am sinking, And brings me joy beyond compare.

### Chorus

My Jesus knows just what I need, O, yes, He knows just what I need; He satisfies, And ev'ry need supplies. Yes, He knows just what I need.

### Verse 3

When other friends seem to forget me, When skies are dark, when hope is gone;  By faith I feel His arms about me, And hear Him say, "You're not alone."
