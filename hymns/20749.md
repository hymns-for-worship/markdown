## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, I commit my life to Thee, Take it, and make it thine own; Make me Thy servant, that I may be Thine, only thine alone!

### Verse 2

Lord, I commit my life, my all, Whate're the service may be; Humbly I answer Thy loving call, Gladly I'll follow Thee!

### Verse 3

Trusting in Thee, I have no fear, Whate're the duty may be; Only to know that my Lord is near, Loving and guiding me.

### Chorus

Lead me, O Lord, I pray, Use me in Thine own way, Even to serve Thee in distant lands, Over the restless sea. May I Thy goodness show at home, where'er I go, May I so live that the lost may see the Christ in me.
