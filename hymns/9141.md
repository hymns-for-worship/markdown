### Verse 1

Jesus, in Gethsemane, prayed, "May this cup pass from Me." He foresaw the agony, "Not My will, but Thine."

### Verse 2

As I live from day to day, Blessed Father, guide my way. May I always think to pray, "Not my will, but Thine."

### Chorus

May this be my lifelong guide: Blessed Savior crucified; Spotless Lamb who bore it all, "Not My will but Thine."
