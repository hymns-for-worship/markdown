## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O fearful slaves of lawlessness, Come out from sin and shame; We are ambassadors for Christ, And call you in His name.

### Verse 2

The Lord's not slow about His word, But patiently relents; He does not wish for you to die; Come quickly to repent!

### Verse 3

A royal welcome will be yours If you will hear the Lord; His joyful work will be your task, And heaven, your reward.

### Chorus

Return to serve the King of kings, And leave the paths you've trod; We beg you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
