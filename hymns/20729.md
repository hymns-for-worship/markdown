## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a shepherd, tender, true, Jesus leads, Jesus leads, Daily finds us pastures new, Jesus leads, Jesus leads; If thick mists are o'er the way, Or the flock 'mid danger feeds, He will watch them lest they stray: Jesus, leads, Jesus leads.

### Verse 2

All along life's rugged road Jesus leads, Jesus leads, Till we reach yon blest abode, Jesus leads, Jesus leads; All the way before He's trod, And He now the flock precedes, Safe into the fold of God: Jesus leads, Jesus leads.

### Verse 3

Thru the sunlit ways of life Jesus leads, Jesus leads; Thru the warrings and the strife Jesus leads, Jesus leads; When we reach the Jordan's tide, Where life's bound'ryline recedes, He will spread the waves aside: Jesus leads, Jesus leads.
