# 159 - When My Love To Christ Grows Weak

## Notation

C - 3/2 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my love to Christ grows weak, when for deeper faith I seek, then in thought I go to Thee, garden of gethsemane!

### Verse 2

There I walk amid the shades, while the lingring twilight fades, see the suffering, friendless one, weeping, praying there alone.

### Verse 3

When my love for man grows weak, when for stronger faith I seek, hill of calvary, I go to the scenes of fear and woe.

### Verse 4

There behold His agony, sufferd on the bitter tree; see his anguish, see his faith, love triumphant still in death.

### Verse 5

Then to life I turn again, learning all the worth of pain, learning all the might that lies in a full selfsacrifice.
