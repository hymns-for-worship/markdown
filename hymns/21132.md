## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hark! ten thousand voices sounding, Far and wide thruout the sky; 'Tis the voice of joy abounding: Je-sus lives no more to die.

### Verse 2

Jesus lives, His conflict over, Lives to claim His great reward; Angels 'round the Victor hover, Crowding to behold their Lord.

### Verse 3

Yonder throne for Him erected Now becomes the Victor's seat; Lo, the Man on earth rejected, Angels worship at His feet!

### Verse 4

All the pow'rs of heav'n a-dore Him; All obey His sov'reign word. Day and night they cry before Him, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord!"
