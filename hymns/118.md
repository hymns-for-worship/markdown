# 118 - Take Time To Be Holy

## Notation

F - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord; abide with Him always, and feed on His word. Make friends of God's children; help those who are weak, forgetting in nothing His blessings to seek.

### Verse 2

Take time to be holy, the world rushes on; spend much time in secret with Jesus alone. Abiding in Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; Thy friends and thy conduct His likeness shall see.

### Verse 3

Take time to be holy, be calm in Thy soul; each thot and each motive beneath His control. This led by His Spirit to fountains of love, Thou soon shall be fitted for service above.
