## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beyond the sunset, o blissful morning, when with our savior heaven is begun. Earth's toiling ended, o glorious dawning, beyond the sunset, when day is done.

### Verse 2

Beyond the sunset, no clouds will gather, no storms will threaten, no fears annoy; o day of gladness, o day unending, beyond the sunset, eternal joy!

### Verse 3

Beyond the sunset, a hand will guide me to God, the father, whom I adore; His glorious presence, His words of welcome, will be my portion on that fair shore.

### Verse 4

Beyond the sunset, o glad reunion with our dear loved ones who've gone before; in that fair homeland we'll know no parting; beyond the sunset forevermore. 

### Coda

Amen.
