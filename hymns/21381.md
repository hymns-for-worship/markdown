## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, O Jesus, my Savior, my all; While nature its music is waking, On Thee from my heart will I call.

### Verse 2

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, O Jesus, my Shepherd and King; Refresh'd with the dews of Thy mercy, Thy wonderful love will I sing.

### Verse 3

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, At noonday, at eve, and at night; I'll tell of Thy goodness forever, My hope, my salvation, my light.

### Chorus

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, My praise to the hills shall ascend; I'll join with the glorified millions, A chorus that never shall end.
