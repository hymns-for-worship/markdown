### Verse 1

My brother, awake, and sing the sweet story,Soon the day of reunion will come; Then O, what a wonderful singing in glory, When all redeemed singers get home.

No mortal hath eâ€™er conceived of its beauty, That awaits the redeemed ones at home; Be sure, my dear brother, you live up to duty, For soon our Redeemer will come.



### Verse 3

Keep working and sing, press onward, my brother, Till the Savior shall bid you to come; How sweet it will be then to meet with each other, When all redeemed singers get home.

Then, O, what a wonderful, wonderful singing, When all redeemed singers get home; Reunion, reunion, thru ages still ringing, When all redeemed singers get home.
