## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Here among the shadows (living) in a lonely land, With strangers we're a band of pilgrims on the move; Thru dangers, burdened down with sorrows, And we're shunned on ev'ry hand, But we are looking for a city built above.

### Verse 2

 In this land of dangers (we are) going here and there, We're simply trusting in the blessed Savior's love; And mercy, tho' we may be strangers, Living in this world of care, We're always looking for a city built above.  

### Chorus

O yes, we're looking for a city, Where we'll never die, There the sainted millions, Never say goodbye, There we'll meet our Savior, And the saved ones too, Come, O Lord, my Savior All our hopes renew.
