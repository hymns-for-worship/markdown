## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Gracious Father, heal my soul; Cleanse of sin, and make me whole; Here's my life, please take control; Gracious Father, heal my soul. Yes, Thy promise I embrace; All my sins Thou wilt erase; Here's my life, please take control; Gracious Father, heal my soul.

### Verse 2

Blessed Jesus, take my hand; Lead me through this sinful land; Give me strength and help me stand; Blessed Jesus, take my hand. With Thy blood Thou didst atone; Thou doest save, and Thou alone; Give my strength, and help me stand; Blessed Jesus take my hand.

### Verse 3

Holy Spirit, guide Thou me; With Thy truth that makes men free; Take my eyes, and help me see; Holy spirit, guide Thou me. Take the darkness from my eyes; Help me gain that blessed prize; Take my eyes, and help me see; Holy Spirit, guide Thou me.
