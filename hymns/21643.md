## Notation

F - 4/4 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You found me walking down life's road, Perplexed by the things that I have seen, Feeling abandoned, lost, confused, And finding my hope not as it seemed, 





### Verse 3

Then let me see You at my side, One step at a time until the end. Tho' I'm a fool and slow of heart, Ignite hope within me once again.









### Chorus

Open my ears to hear the story. Open my heart that I may trust. Open my eyes to clearly see You, Risen from death, victorious.
Open Your mouth, unveil the myst'ry, Scriptures that cause my heart to burn. You have arisen out of Sheol. Open my grave when You return.


### Verse 2

Lord, I can't take another step, And mountains of sorrow fill my road. Have You not heard my hope has died, Nor witnessed my weary weight of woe?
