### Verse 1

Are you weighed down with cares of life? Weak in temptation, faint in strife? Lean on the Lord to help you through; Almighty God will strengthen you.

### Verse 2

Are you alone and far away? Find a calm place to sing and pray; For in the midst are gathered two: All present God is there with you.

### Verse 3

Are you afraid of coming years? Filled with uncertain joys and tears? Blessings or burdens, great or few, All knowing God knows best for you.
