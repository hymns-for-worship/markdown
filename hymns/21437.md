## Lyrics

### Verse 1

After the lifepaths we're treading End upon time's solemn shore, There will be light at the river While the redeemed ones pass o'er.

### Verse 2

There will be light for the spirits Who thru deep shadows have gone, Fadeless light shining glad welcome Out from the windows of home.

### Verse 3

There will be light for the weary Who thru sore trials have passed, Radiant light as they enter Peace that forever shall last.

### Verse 4

There will be light for the faithful, What e'er the way they have trod, Glorious light sent to guide them Safe to the city of God.

### Chorus

There will be light at the river, There will be light at the river, There will be light at the river, While the redeemed ones pass o'er.
