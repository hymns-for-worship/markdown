## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saves a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.

### Verse 2

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved; how precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.

### Verse 3

Thru many dangers toils and snares I have already come; twas grace that bro't me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.

### Verse 4

The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.

### Verse 5

When we've been there tenthousand years, bright shining as the sun; we've no lesss days to sing God's praise then when we first begun.
