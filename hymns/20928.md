My Lord, now I live, for I've heard, And hearing has come by Your word. In joy for the life You've restored, My song is the law of the Lord.

Tho' Satan pursues me with strife, Your Spirit delivers my life. I've taken Your Word for my sword; My song is the law of the Lord.

And when my departure draws near, Your Word will enlighten my fear. I'll say of my promised reward, "My song is the law of the Lord!"
