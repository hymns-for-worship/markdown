## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Upon the first day of the week, our savior gave forth from the grave; he died, was buried, then arose, to reign, to triumph and to save!

### Verse 2

Upon the first day of the week, disciples met to break the bread, and drink the cup in memory of him whose blood for us was shed!

### Verse 3

Upon the first day of the week, let each of us lay by in store, as blessed and prospered by the Lord, the King of kings whom we adore!

### Verse 4

Upon the day "beloved" John, saw Christ, and heard his trumpet voice; we, too, in spirit worship him, with prayer and song our hearts rejoice!

### Chorus

Though others may forsake the Lord, yet we are here thy truth to seek; thy holy presence comforts us, upon the first day of the week.
