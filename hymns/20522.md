### Verse 1

I bring my sins to Thee, The sins I cannot count, That all  may cleansed be In Thy once opened fount: I bring them, Savior, all to Thee; The burden is too great for me. The burden is too great for me.

### Verse 2

I bring my grief to Thee, The grief I cannot tell; No word shall needed by Thou knowest all so well: I bring the sorrow laid on me, O suff'ring Savior, all to Thee, O suff'ring Savior, all to Thee.

### Verse 3

My life I bring to Thee; I would not be my own; O Savior, let me be Thine ever, Thine alone: My heart, my life,  my all I bring To Thee, my Savior and my King, To Thee, my Savior and my King.
