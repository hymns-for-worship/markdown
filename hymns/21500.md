### Verse 1

Jesus Christ, the blessed Lamb, On the cross, bled and died. Ransomed from my sins I am, In the Crucified; All the world to me is dross, All it's pomp I resign, Now my wealth is at the cross, All its charms are mine.


### Verse 2

What care I for worldly gain, When my Lord gives me this? I renounce the earth as vain, Choosing Heaven's bliss; Afric's gems nor Ophir's gold, Can with this ever compare, More than earthly wealth I hold, Heaven's crown I'll wear.
