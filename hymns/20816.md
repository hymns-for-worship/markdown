### Verse 1

I met Him one day on a lonely road, The Christ of Galilee; 'Twas there that He lifted my heavy load, The Man of Galilee;

### Verse 2

I yielded my life to him that day, The Christ of Galilee; He's walking with me all along the way, The Man of Galilee;

### Verse 3

He gives me a song that none other can give, The Christ of Galilee; I'll honor and serve Him each day I live, The Man of Galilee;

### Verse 4

Someday He is coming again for me, The Man of Galilee; Transformed in His beauty, His face I'll see, The Man of Galilee;

Wonderful Man of Galilee; Wonderful Man of Galilee; He's dearer than all the world to me, This wonderful Man of Galilee.
