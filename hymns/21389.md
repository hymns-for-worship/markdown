## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end; Be Thou forever near me, My Master and my friend; I shall not fear the battle If Thou art by my side, Nor wander from the pathway If Thou wilt be my guide.

### Verse 2

O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever near; I see the sights that dazzle, The tempting sounds I hear; My foes are ever near me, Around me and within; But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, And shield my soul from sin.

### Verse 3

O let me hear Thee speaking In accents clear and still, Above the storms of passion, The murmurs of selfwill. O speak to reassure me, To hasten or control; O speak, and make me listen, Thou guardian of my soul.

### Verse 4

O Jesus, Thou hast promised To all who follow Thee That where Thou art in glory There shall Thy servant be. And Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end; O give me grace to follow, My Master and my friend.
