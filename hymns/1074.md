### Verse 1

He'll go with me on that journey by and by. He'll go with me on that journey to the skies. I won't have to go alone, He will take me safely home. He'll go with me on that journey by and by.

### Verse 2

He will take me home to glory by and by, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. He'll go with me all the way. He won't let me go astray. He'll go with me on that journey by and by.

He'll go with me, He'll go with me, Go with me as I travel to my home beyond the skies, He'll go with me, He'll go with me, Go with me on my journey by and by.
