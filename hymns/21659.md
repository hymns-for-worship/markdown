## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sweet the moment, rich in blessing, Which before the cross we spend; Life and health and peace possessing, From the dying sinner's friend.  Hallelujah! Hallelujah! From the dying sinner's friend. 



### Verse 2

Truly blessed in our station, Low before His cross we lie; While we see divine compassion, Beaming in His gracious eye. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Beaming in His gracious eye. 


### Verse 3

Love and grief our hearts dividing, With our tears His feet we'll bathe; Constant still, in faith abiding, Life deriving from His death. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Life diriving from His death.



### Verse 4

May we still enjoy this feeling, Still to our Redeemer go; Prove His wounds each day more healing; And Himself more truly know. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! And Himself more truly know.
