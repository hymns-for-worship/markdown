### Verse 1

Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my savior, waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!

### Verse 2

Vainly, they watch His bed, Jesus my savior, vainly they seal the dead, Jesus ,my Lord!

### Verse 3

Death cannot keep His prey, Jesus my savior, He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!

### Chorus

Up from the grave He arose with a mighty triumph o'er His foes, He arose a victor from the dark domain and He lives forever with His saints to reign; He arose, He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!
