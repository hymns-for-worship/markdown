## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Deeper than the ocean and wider than the sea, Is the grace of the Savior for sinners like me; Sent from the Father, and it thrills my soul, Just to feel and to know that His blood makes me whole. 

### Verse 2

 Higher than the mountains and brighter than the sun, It was offered at Calv'ry for ev'ryone; Greatest of treasures, and it's mine today, Tho' my sins were as scarlet, He has washed them away. 

### Chorus

His grace reaches me, yes, His grace reaches me, And 'twill last thru eternity; Now I'm under His control and I'm happy in my soul, Just to know that His grace reaches me.
