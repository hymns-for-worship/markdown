Â Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it! Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; Redeemed thru His infinite mercy, His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus, No language my rapture can tell; I know that the light of His presence With me doth continually dwell.

I know I shall see in His beauty, The King in whose law I delight; Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps, And giveth me songs in the night.
