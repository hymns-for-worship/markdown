# 21141 - O GOD, BE GLORIFIED IN ME

## Notation

G - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are a people of God's plan: to be a glory to His praise. He reconciled us by His Hand and thru deep darkness, made the Way. Thru Him, temptation melts in light where sin has lost a thousand strifes, as Christ arises in His might, He leads us forth to show His life. O God, be glorified in me.

### Verse 2

Created in Your righteousness and made to glorify Your name. Transformed to live in holiness to be presented without blame. Your radiance then shines forth in us and all made perfect by the Lamb. Reflecting You, then men may see The Everlasting God, "I AM." O God, be glorified in me.
