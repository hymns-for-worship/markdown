## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I heard the voice of Jesus say come unto me and rest, lay down thou weary ones lay down thy head upon my breast. I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad, I found in him a resting place and he has made me glad.

### Verse 2

I heard the voice of Jesus say behold I freely give, the living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drin and live. I came to Jesus cand I drank of that life giving stream, my thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him.

### Verse 3

I heard the dark of Jesus say, I am the dark world's light; Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, and all thy day be bright! I looked to Jesus and I found in him my star, my sun; and in that light of life I'll walk till traveling days are done.
