## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the moment He appears and the light from heaven shines, I'll forget ev'ry fear, ev'ry pain I'll leave behind. Then I'll see Him as He is and I'll know Him as I'm known. Ev'ry tear wiped away when I go home. 

### Verse 2

Ever present is the tho't that a moment waits for me when unworthy as I am, His glory I will see. I will empty all my praise before my Father's throne. Ev'ry tear wiped away when I go home. 

### Verse 3

If the trial I endure and your presence I can't find, be near me, Lord, I pray, bring back unto my mind That your promises are firm and I'm never on my own. Ev'ry tear wiped away when I go home.
