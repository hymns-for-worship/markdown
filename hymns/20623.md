# 20623 - MEEKNESS AND MAJESTY

## Notation

D - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Meekness and majesty, Manhood and Deity. In perfect harmony, The man Who is God: Lord of eternity Dwells in humanity Kneels in humility And washes our feet.

### Verse 2

Father's pure radiance, Perfect in innocence, Yet, learns obedience To death on a cross: Suff'ring to give us life, Conq'ring thru sacrifice, And as they crucify, Prays, "Father forgive."

### Verse 3

Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible. Love indestructible In frailty appears: Lord of infinity, Stooping so tenderly, Lifts our humanity To heights of His throne.

### Chorus

O what a mystery, Meekness and majesty. Bow down and worship, For this is your God.
