## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When Jesus stood at Lazarus' tomb and none believed He had the pow'r, Despite their grief and their disbelief, He commanded, "Take away the stone."

### Verse 2

 When Jesus lay in Joseph's tomb and none believed He had the pow'r, True Love spoke forth in a Father's voice, And the angel took away the stone.

### Verse 3

 When I shall lie within my tomb and none believe He has the pow'r, The Lord Himself will descend from heav'n with a shout to take away the stone.
