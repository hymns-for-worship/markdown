## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are many today who have wandered away, They are out in the fields of sin. Once they walked in the light; now they grope thru the night. O Lord, give us faithful men!

### Verse 2

Give us men who are strong when the battle is long, Give us men with the will to win. Men courageous and true, though their number be few. O Lord, give us faithful men!

### Verse 3

There's no time for delay; men are needed today, Men persistent unto the end; Men whose feet are secure on the Rock that is sure. O Lord, give us faithful men!

### Chorus

Faithful men, Faithful men, Faithful men, Faithful men, To recapture the vision again. Give us men who are true, and loyal thru and thru, O Lord, give us faithful men.
