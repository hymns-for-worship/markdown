## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Swift to hear the mighty word. Swift to do what we have heard. Swift to look into the mirror. Swift to dwell upon His word. 

### Verse 2

Slow to speak what's on your mind. Slow and sure that you are kind. Slow and careful what you're saying. Slow to say what's on your mind.

### Verse 3

Slow to wrath upon your friend. Slow to wrath that brings more sin. Slow to anger hurting others. Wrath produces sinful men.

### Chorus

Swiftly listen, slowly speak. Slow to wrath, but goodness seek. God can swiftly save your soul. Don't forget Who made you whole!
