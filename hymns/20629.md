## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I cannot praise You, Lord enough, For all You've done for me. Forgive me, Lord, for having failed, In this my soul should see. I cannot glorify You, Lord, nor sing Your worthy praise. For insufficient is my mind. To form sufficient phrase.

### Verse 2

But, Lord, I hope and pray each day, That You may see in me, My will to serve without reserve. My God, My Godhead Three, I'll try to hold within my soul determination true, To serve no god, No other god, No other god but You.
