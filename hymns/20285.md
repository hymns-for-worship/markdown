## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Go to Jesus for rest, when your soul is distressed, He has promised help, if we obey; Lift your heart up in prayer, cast on Him all your care, He will take all your burdens away.

### Verse 2

Go to Jesus for rest, of all friends He's the best, He will comfort the soul in our grief; So, whatever betide, always in Him confide, He in mercy will give us relief.

### Verse 3

Go to Jesus for rest, in this life He's our guest, Treat Him kindly lest He shall depart; Do not trouble your mind with the things left behind, Let the Savior abide in your heart.
