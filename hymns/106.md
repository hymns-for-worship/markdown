## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If I have wounded any soul today, if I have caused one foot to go astray, if I have walked in my own wilful way, dear Lord, forgive!

### Verse 2

If I have uttered idle words or vain, if I have turned aside from want or pain, lest I myself shall suffer thru the strain, dear Lord, forgive!

### Verse 3

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee; forgive the secret sins I do not see; o guide me, love me, and my keeper be, in Jesus' name.
