## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The night is fast passing, The day is at hand, Day is at hand, We’ve sighted the mountains of Beulah land, Sweet Beulah land.

### Verse 2

With songs of Thanksgiving The glorified band, Glorified band, Are sounding their welcome to Beulah land, Sweet Beulah land.

### Verse 3

The Lamb on Mount Zion With nail pierced hand, Nail pierced hand, Has opened the portals of Beulah land, Sweet Beulah land.

### Verse 4

Then sing, weary pilgrims, You’re nearing the strand, Nearing the strand, Where loved ones await you in Beulah land, Sweet Beulah land.

### Chorus

We’ll say good morning in glory, Good morning, good morning, We’ll say good morning in glory, When the darkness has turned to day.
