## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Savior dear I love Thee, O I love Thee, For Thou hast made my blinded eyes to see, Redeemed my soul upon the cross of Calv'ry And from the bonds of sin hath made me free.

### Verse 2

When stormy clouds of doubt and sin were raging, And I was tossed upon the sea of life, You whispered peace and ev'ry wave obeyed Thee, You gave me pow'r to conquer ev'ry strife.

### Verse 3

My Savior dear, how can I e'er repay Thee For Thy great love and sacrifice for me? I feel, dear Lord, that I am so unworthy Of Thy atoning blood that made me free.

### Chorus

I now am happy in Thy loving favor, I would that others this great love should know; I'll praise Thy name thruout the endless ages, My Savior dear, my Savior dear, I love Thee so.
