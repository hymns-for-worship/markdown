## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, let me have the true mind of Christ, That I may learn how to sacrifice. He came from heaven to save my lost soul, He gave His dear life to make me whole.

### Verse 2

A humble servant He came to be, Obeyed His Father so willingly. He suffered death there on Calvary's cross. To save my soul from eternal loss.

### Verse 3

Our God exalted His only Son; Gave Him a name above ev'ry one. Bow down your knee and exalt His great name; In  heaven and earth it is the same.
