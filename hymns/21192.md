## Lyrics

### Verse 1

So long I had searched for life's meaning, Enslaved by the world and my greed; Then the door of my prison was opened by love, For the ransom was paid, I was freed.

### Verse 2

I'm free from the guilt that I carried, From the dull empty life I'm set free; For when I met Jesus He made me complete He forgot how foolish I used to be.

### Chorus

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow; I'm free from the guilt of the past; For I've traded my shackles for a glorious song I'm free! Praise the Lord! Free at last!
