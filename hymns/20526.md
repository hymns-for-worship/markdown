## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a crown for your cross, when the teardrops that stray, Will be driven forever away; Where the cares that oppress will at last be laid down, You'll be given a beautiful crown.

### Verse 2

There's a crown for your cross, when the daylight shall dawn, When the night's dreary shadows are gone; You will meet with glad smiles and never a frown, You'll be given a beautiful crown.

### Verse 3

There's a crown for your cross, where the sweet flowers grow, On the banks where bright waters doth flow; Where the Savior awaits at the beautiful gate, You'll be given a beautiful crown.

### Chorus

There's a crown for your cross, there is gain for your loss, You'll be given a crown for your cross; There's a beautiful crown when your cross is laid down, You'll be given a beautiful crown.

### Verse 4

There's a crown for your cross, and a power divine, There's a love all around you will shine; Where the cross for the crown is forever laid down, You'll be given a beautiful crown.
