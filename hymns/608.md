# 608 - The Love Of God

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 2+ - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The love of God is greater far, Than tongue or pen can ever tell; It goes beyond the highest star, And reaches to the lowest hell; The guilty pair bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win; His erring child He reconciled, And pardoned from his sin. 

### Verse 2

 When hoary time shall pass away, And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall; When men who here refuse to pray, On rocks and hills and mountains call; God's love, so sure, shall still endure, All measureless and strong; Redeeming grace to Adam's race 

### Verse 3

 Could we with ink the ocean fill, And were the skies of parchment made; Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill, And ev'ry man a scribe by trade; To write the love of God above Would drain the ocean dry; Nor could the scroll contain the whole, Tho' stretch'd from sky to sky. 

### Chorus

O, love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall for evermore endure– The saints' and an gels song.
