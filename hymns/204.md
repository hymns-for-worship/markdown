# 204 - Never Grow Old

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have heard of a land on a far away strand, tis a beautiful home of the soul; built by Jesus on high, where he never shall die, tis a land where he'll never grow old.

### Verse 2

In that beautiful home, where we'll nevermore roam, we shall be in the sweet by and by; happy praise to the king thru eternity sing, tis a land where we never shall die.

### Verse 3

When our work here is done and the life crown is won, and our troubles and trials are o'er; all our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend, with the loved ones who've gone on before.

### Chorus

Never grow old, never grow old, in a land where we'll never grow old; never grow old, never grow old, in a land where we'll never grow old.
