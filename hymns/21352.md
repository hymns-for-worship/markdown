## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come and listen to my tale, Sit here close and hear me well; I've a story sweet and true, And I'll tell it now to you.

### Verse 2

I was sick and nearing death, Gasping for my final breath, But He took me in His arms, Now I sing this glorious song.

### Verse 3

In His love and by His grace I have peace I can't explain, But I think of those I knew; We must go and tell them, too.

### Chorus

Of the words my ears have heard, How my heart with sorrow stirred; How my lips confessed the Christ! How the water washed me white. 

### Coda

How the water washed me white.
