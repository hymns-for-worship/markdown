## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some day the silver cord will break, And I no more as now shall sing; But, O, the joy when I shall wake Within the palace of the King!



### Verse 2

Some day my earthly house will fall, I cannot tell how soon 'twill be, But this I know: my All in All Has now a place in heav'n for me.

### Verse 3

Some day till then I'll watch and wait, My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, That when my Savior opes the gates, My soul to Him may take its flight.



### Chorus

And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And
tell the story saved by grace.
