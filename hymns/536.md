# 536 - O, The Things We May Do

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Have you lifted a stone from your brother's way, As He struggled along life's road? Have you lovingly touched some frail, toilworn hand, Shared with someone his heavy load?

### Verse 2

 Have you spoken a word full of hope and cheer? Have you walked with a slower pace, Till the weary of heart who were stumbling on, Took new courage to run the race?

### Verse 3

 Have you held up your light thru the shadows dark, So that somebody else might see? Have you lived with the Christ thru the long, long day, Gaining many a victory? 

### Chorus

O the things we may do, you and I, you and I, O, the love we can give if we try, Just a word or a song as we're passing along, They will count in the great by and by.
