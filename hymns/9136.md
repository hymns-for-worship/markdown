## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Look above and see the heavens, far beyond this rock and sod. For as great as is the distance is the mercy of our God.

### Verse 2

See the span between the rising and the setting of the sun; Just as far, He's taken from us all the wrong that we  have done.

### Verse 3

As a father loves his children, though they test his love again, Even so, our Father loves us and forgives us of our sin.
