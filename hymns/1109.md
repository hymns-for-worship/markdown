## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O fill my cup, let it overflow, O fill my cup, let it overflow, O fill my cup, let it overflow, Let it overflow with love.

### Verse 2

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.

### Verse 3

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed.

### Verse 4

The Lord has promised good to me: His word my hope secures; His will my shield and portion be As long as life endures.

### Verse 5

When we've been there ten-thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praise Than when we've first begun.

### Verse 6

O fill my cup, let it overflow, O fill my cup, let it overflow, O fill my cup, let it overflow, Let it overflow with love.
