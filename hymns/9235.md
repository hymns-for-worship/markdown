## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Consider the mornings of this mortal land, Each a new beginning from the Maker's hand. While the storms may gather 'gainst the evening sky, The day breaks cloudless in the morning.

### Verse 2

Rise up to the battle, for the skies dawn clear; Let us gather courage while the foe draws near. Though the night falls weary, saints of God march on! And He'll raise our banner in the morning.

### Verse 3

When the trumpet sounds to signal Heaven's day, Resurrection Morning when the dead shall wake, What a glorious gath'ring when the Lord descends And we rise to meet Him in the morning. 

### Chorus

How long, my Lord? Till we see the morning? How long, my Lord, till we see Your face? O my Lord, my Lord, guide us through our troubles Till we rise above them in the morning.
