## Notation

A - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am clinging to the Rock, blessed saving Rock, While the angry storms may o'er me roll; I am sheltered 'neath the cleft from the tempest's shock, Blessed Refuge to my weary soul.

### Verse 2

I am clinging to the Rock, blessed Rock of Faith, There I see my Savior's loving form; I am looking unto Him while my fleeting breath Wafts His praises thru the piercing storm.

### Verse 3

I am clinging to the Rock, blessed Rock of Hope, Keeping near the Savior's bleeding side; I am anchored to the Rock that was cleft for me, Near the fountain of the crimson tide.


### Verse 4

I am clinging to the Rock, blessed Rock of Love, Let me, Lord, upon Thy bosom rest; I am waiting for the time to be called above, With the ransomed there forever blest.

### Chorus

I am clinging, clinging, clinging to the Rock; Blessed Refuge, Thou art dear to me; I am clinging, clinging, I am clinging to the Rock, Blessed Savior, I will cling to Thee.
