# 21438 - WHERE THEY NEED NO SUN

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my earthly day is waning And my mortal robe I fold, With the dawning of eternity begun; I shall enter gates of pearl to walk on streets of shining gold, In that city where they need no sun.

### Verse 2

O'er the fields of endless glory I shall wander with delight, For with sadness and with pain I shall be done; No more sorrow, no more sickness in that home so pure and bright, In that city where they need no sun.

### Verse 3

With the countless bloodwashed millions I shall sing beyond the skies, Praise to God and to "The Lamb for sinners slain;" As the sound of many waters this triumphant song shall rise, And resound thruout God's vast domain.

### Chorus

In that city where they need no sun, When at last my earthly race is run I shall see my Savior's face, Revel in His love and grace In that city where they need no sun.
