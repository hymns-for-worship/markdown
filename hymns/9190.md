## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jerusalem, the golden, With milk and honey blest! Beneath thy contemplation Sink heart and voice oppressed; I know not, O I know not What joys await me there; What radiancy of glory, What bliss beyond compare.

### Verse 2

They stand, those halls of Zion, All jublilant with song, And bright with many angels, And all the martyr throng; The Prince is ever in them, The daylight is serene; The pastures of the blessed Are decked in glorious sheen.

### Verse 3

O sweet and blessed country, Shall I e'er see thy face? O sweet and blessed country, Shall I e'er win thy grace? Exult, O dust and ashes! The Lord shall be thy part; His only, His forever, Thou shalt be, and thou art!
