## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I know my heav'nly Father knows The storms that would my way oppose; But He can drive the clouds away, And turn my darkness into day, And turn my darkness into day.

### Verse 2

I know my heav'nly Father knows The balm I need to soothe my woes, And with His touch of love divine, He heals this wounded soul of mine, He heals this wounded soul of mine.

### Verse 3

I know my heav'nly Father knows How frail I am to meet my foes, But He my cause will e'er defend, Uphold and keep me to the end, Uphold and keep me to the end.

### Verse 4

I know my heav'nly Father knows The hour my journey here will close, And may that hour, O faithful Guide Find me safe sheltered by Thy side, Find me safe sheltered by Thy side.

### Chorus

He knows, He knows, The storms that would my way oppose; He knows, He knows, And tempers ev'ry wind that blows.
