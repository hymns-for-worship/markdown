# 21294 - I'LL FOLLOW

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've heard my Savior calling, "Take up thy cross, follow Me." In tender tones He is pleading, "Come now and from sin be free." 

### Verse 2

Tho' He may lead thru the valley, And sometime the way seems so drear, 'Tis joy to know He is with me, My Savior is always near.

### Verse 3

Sometimes He leads to the conflict, Where foes, strong and mighty assail, But in His strength I can conquer, Thru Him I can e'er prevail.

### Chorus

The way is very narrow but I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow. The way is very narrow but I'll follow, I'll follow Jesus all the way.
