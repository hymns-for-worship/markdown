## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in His excellent word! What more can He say than to you He has said, You who unto Jesus, You who unto Jesus, You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

### Verse 2

Fear not, I am with you, O be not dismayed, For I am your God and will still give you aid; I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand, Upheld by My gracious, Upheld by My gracious, Upheld by My gracious, omnipotent hand.

### Verse 3

When thru the deep waters I cause you to go, The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow, For I will be with you, your troubles to bless, And sanctify to you, And sanctify to you, And sanctify to you your deepest distress.

### Verse 4

The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose I will not, I will not desert to his foes; That soul, tho' all hell should endeavor to shake, I'l never, no never, I'll never, no never, I'll never, no never, no never forsake."
