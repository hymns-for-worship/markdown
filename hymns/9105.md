## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He giveth life and joy and tears and nature's frowns and smiles and fears, And Christ to guide and set me free from sin and dread and comfort me.

### Verse 2

He lifts me up from spirits low, when tossed by sorrows, I must know, He giveth sunshine after rain, and love as balm for giref and pain.

### Verse 3

I've paths to walk where flowers bloom, where singing birds shall banish gloom, My faith shall stand in wind and lee, for there is someone guiding me.

### Verse 4

He guides in ev'ry path I tread, for I'm His child, my God hath said, And from that shade 'neath yonder tree, a hand extends. My God' 'Tis He.
