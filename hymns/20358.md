## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Savior daily walks with me Because I trust His love, In all that's best His hand I see, It points to heavn' above; I will follow Him thru shadows dim or in the sunshine bright, And on we walk together, Leads my steps aright. 

### Verse 2

My Savior holds my hand each day And tells me not to fear, When tempted, to Him I must pray, For He is always near; On the gospel road He'll share my load, Sin can't my soul affright,  and He   

### Chorus

On we walk together, Christ is by my side, Fear no stormy weather, For He is a faithful guide; You can't find another, Waves obey His will, Speaks to you, my brother Come and hear His "Peace be still".

### Verse 3

Upon my blessed Lord I lean, My all to Him confide, No more the shadows come between, I'm walking by His side; In true faith will I on Him rely, He makes my burdens light,
