### Verse 1

All day long of Jesus I am singing, He my song of joy will ever be; All the while I keep my heartbells ringing, for His love is everything to me.

### Verse 2

Streams of love around my soul are flowing, from His heart, love's everlasting spring; that is why my faith in Him I'm showing, that is why an endless song I sing.

### Verse 3

In His light, I'm going home to glory, with the souls who trust His saving grace; going home to sing and tell His story in the blessed sunshine of His face.

### Chorus

He's my glorious King, and O I dearly love Him, He's my King, no other is above Him, all day long enraptured praise I sing, He's my Savior, He's my King!
