## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Weeping garden gently bow your leaves. Wilt beside the Savior as He grieves. Turn away the splendor of each flow'r. Hush the birds in this, His desp'rate hour.

### Verse 2

Weeping garden look upon His face. See His anguish tempered by such grace. As He suffers, sweat pours out as blood. Let your sorrow drip from ev'ry bud.

### Verse 3

Weeping garden how the twilight dims, Thru your canopy of twisted limbs. Traitors lurking near the garden's bliss. Whisper of a cold betrayal kiss.

### Verse 4

Weeping garden hear the pray'r He speaks. Not His will, but God's, He humbly seeks. Greater love has never been displayed. Weep with Him who weeps beneath your shade!
