## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, Rose of Sharon, bloom within my heart; Beauties of Thy truth and holiness impart, That where'er I go my life may shed abroad Fragrance of the knowledge of the love of God.

### Verse 2

 Jesus, Rose of Sharon, sweeter far to see Than the fairest flow'rs of earth could ever be, Fill my life complet-ly, adding more each day Of Thy grace divine and purity, I pray.

### Verse 3

 Jesus, Rose of Sharon, bloom forevermore; Be Thy glory seen on earth from shore to shore, Till the nations own Thy sov'reign-ty complete, Lay their honors down and worship at Thy feet. 

### Chorus

Jesus, Rose of Sharon, Bloom in radiance and in love within my heart.
