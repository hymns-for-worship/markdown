## Lyrics

### Verse 1

To You, O God, my praise I give, For in Your care I want to live. Your words created ev'rything, To praise You, Lord, I gladly sing.

### Verse 2

The rising sun, the oceans deep, The fertile soil, the foods we reap; You gave me these, You really care, I'll praise You for Your love so rare.

### Verse 3

A peaceful night to rest in bed, To read the Words that You have said, I'll praise You for the Holy book: Your will I'll learn if I just look.

### Verse 4

You gave Your Son, Your only Son, To die for me: Your will was done. Unworthily I hide my face; I'll praise You for Your saving grace.

### Verse 5

I'll sing Your praises ev'ry morn, Tho' some will frown and others scorn, I'll praise You for Your love and care; And Jesus' name I'll gladly wear.

### Chorus

I'll praise Your name; I'll praise Your name, My head held high, there will be no shame. Then after death, I'll sing always; At home, dear Lord, I'll sing Your praise.
