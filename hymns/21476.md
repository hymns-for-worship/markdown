## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O troubled heart, there is a home Beyond the reach of toil and care; A home where changes never come: Who would not fain be resting there. 

### Verse 2

Yet when bowed down beneath the load By Heav’n allowed, thine earthly lot; Look up! thou’lt reach that blest abode; Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.

### Verse 3

Toil on, nor deem, tho’ sore it be, One sigh unheard, one pray'r forgot; The day of rest will dawn for thee; Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.


### Chorus

O wait, meekly wait, and murmur not, O wait, meekly wait, and murmur not O wait, O wait, O wait, and murmur not.
