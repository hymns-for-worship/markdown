## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Open my eyes, that I may see glimpses of truth Thou hast for me; place in my hands the wonderful key that shall unclasp, and set me free. Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see: open my eyes, illumine me, Savior divine!

### Verse 2

Open my ears, that I may hear Thy word of truth Thou sendest clear; and while the wavenotes fall on my ear, everything false will disappear. Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see: open my ears,  illumine me, Savior divine!

### Verse 3

Open my mouth, and let me bear gladly the warm truth everywhere; open my heart, and let me prepare love with Thy children thus to share. Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see: open my heart, illumine me, Savior divine!
