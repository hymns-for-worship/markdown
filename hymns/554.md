## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I am a stranger here, within a foreign land; My home is far away upon a golden strand, A messenger to be of realms beyond the sea, I'm here on bus'ness for my King. This is the message that I bring, A message angels fain would sing: "O, be ye reconciled," Thus saith my Lord and King, "O, be ye reconciled to God." 

### Verse 2

 This is the King's command that all men ev'rywhere, Repent and turn away from sin's seductive snare; That all who will obey, with Him shall live for aye, And that's my bus'ness for my King. This is the message that I bring, A message angels fain would sing: "O, be ye reconciled," Thus saith my Lord and King, "O, be ye reconciled to God." 

### Verse 3

 My home is brighter far than Sharon's rosy plain, Eternal life and joy thru'out its vast domain; My Sovreign bids me tell how mortals there may dwell, And that's my bus'ness for my King. This is the message that I bring, A message angels fain would sing: "O, be ye reconciled," Thus saith my Lord and King, "O, be ye reconciled to God." Amen.
