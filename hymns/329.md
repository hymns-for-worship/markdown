## Lyrics

### Chorus

God is calling, calling yet, God is calling, sinner heed his pleading voice.

### Verse 1

God calling yet, shall I not hear? Earths pleasures I shall still hold dear? Shall life's swift passing years all fly, and still my soul in slumber lie?

### Verse 2

God calling yet! Shall I not rise? Can I his loving voice despise, and basely his kind care repay? He calls me still can I delay?

### Verse 3

God calling yet! I cannot stay; my heart I yield without delay; vain world, farewell, from thee I part; the voice of God has reached my heart.
