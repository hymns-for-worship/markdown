## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Lord, when first I came to You, You promised me a price: To give up self for life made new, To toil and sacrifice. To give up self, to toil and sacrifice.

### Verse 2

But as I lived Your sacrifice, I left the things before; I could not love what once enticed, For now I loved You more. I could not love, for now I loved You more.

### Verse 3

In You, I learned that all I'd lost Was worthless, vain, and small, So when I turned to count the cost, I saw no cost at all. So when I turned, I saw no cost at all.
