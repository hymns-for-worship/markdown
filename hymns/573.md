## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Can you count the stars of evening That are shining in the sky? Can you count the clouds that daily Over all the world go by? God the Lord, who doth not slumber, Keepeth all the boundless number; But He careth more for thee, But He careth more for thee. 

### Verse 2

 Can you count the clouds that daily Over all the world go by? Can you count the little fishes That in spark'ling waters play? God the Lord their number knoweth, For each one His care He showeth: Shall He not remember thee? Shall He not remember thee?

### Verse 3

 Can you count the many children, In their little beds at night, Who without a thought of sorrow Rise again at morning light? God the Lord, who dwells in heaven, Loving care to each has given: He has not forgotten thee, He has not forgotten thee.
