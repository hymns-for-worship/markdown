## Lyrics

### Verse 1

High above in yonder tree, Sang a mockingbird to me. Seems it's lovely voice to say, Surely God has blest your way.




### Verse 2

And I thank my God above, That my way is blest with love; Blest with all that nature gives, Blest because Jehovah lives.


### Verse 3

 I shall hear as nature rings, I shall feel the joy it brings; Doubting not that God is near; See, His love is everywhere. 


### Verse 4

God, I ask that as I live, I accept whate'er You give. Touch my heart, my fears to quell; Oft remind that all is well.
