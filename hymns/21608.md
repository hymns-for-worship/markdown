## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The voice of the Lord is over the waters, the God of all glory thunders. The voice of the Lord is filled with power, the voice of the Lord is majestic. The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon; He makes her skip like a calf. The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning, it shakes the desert sand. O, listen and hear as the silence is shattered, with all of creation rejoice. O, listen and hear, for one day all the nations will bow at the sound of His voice.
