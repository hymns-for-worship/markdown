## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Dear Lord, I pray that Thou wilt help me bear my heavy load; Please share it with me, precious Lord, till  I walk heaven's road. 

### Verse 2

 For in this world I know I need a thorn within my side. On Thee, my God, I will depend, and in Thy grace abide.

### Verse 3

 If in this life I had no care to burden me each day, I may not long for heaven's home as I pass by this way. 

### Verse 4

 So, my dear God, I do not ask that I be burden free; Just hold my hand in Thine, dear Lord, and lead me home to Thee. 

### Coda

Amen.
