## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 We're part of the fam'ly that's been born again; Part of the fam'ly whose love knows no end; For Jesus has saved us, and made us His own, Now we're part of the fam'ly that's on its way home.

### Verse 2

 When a brother meets sorrow we all feel his grief; When he's passed thru the valley we all feel relief; Together in sunshine, together in rain, Together in vict'ry thru His precious name.

### Verse 3

 And tho' some go before us, we'll all meet again; Just inside the city as we enter in; There'll be no more parting, with Jesus we'll be; Together forever, God's family. 

### Chorus

And sometimes we laugh together, sometimes we cry; Sometimes we share together, heartaches and sighs; Sometimes we dream together of how it will be; When we all get to Heaven, God's family.
