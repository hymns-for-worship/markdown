# 471 - Why Can't We See

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 This life's too short and filled with pain, To waste our time for earthly gain; It has to be much sweeter there, Why can't we see? Lord, hear our prayer. 

### Verse 2

 If I could live my life again, I'd keep it free from so much sin, I would not hurt the ones I love, I want to please my Lord above.

### Verse 3

 When strife is stirred by angry words, Help me to think of Thee, O Lord, Help me to know that Thou art there, Help me to see, Lord, hear my prayer. 

### Chorus

Why can't we see? Why do we sin? We must not let the tempter in; O Jesus, make our hearts Thy throne, So we can see we're not alone.
