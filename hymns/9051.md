## Notation

G - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, help me see Your blessings; Show forth Your grace to me, For I am proud and willful And oft refuse to see. Reveal Your love unceasing, Your mercy manifold, In both the gifts You bring me And those that You withold.

### Verse 2

In childish understanding,  Ithink that I know best How You should hear my pleading And answer each request. But You, beloved Father, Are wiser far than I, And Your unerring judgment Must shape the best reply.

### Verse 3

Lord, help me see Your blessings; I have no other need, But faith to see the blessing In all You have decreed. More trust would teach contentment With what You plan above, For sorrow must be blessing If given by Your love.
