## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O perfect love, all human thot transcending, lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne, that theirs may be the love which knows no ending, whom thou forever more dost join in one.

### Verse 2

O perfect life be thou their full assurance of tender charity and steadfast faith, of patient hope and quiest, brave endurance, with childlike trust, that fears no pain nor death.

### Verse 3

Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrows; grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,  and to lifes day the glorious unknown morrow that dawns upon eternal love and life.
