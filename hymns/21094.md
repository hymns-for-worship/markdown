### Verse 1

We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord, We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord, And we pray that our unity may one day be restored:

### Verse 2

We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand, We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand, And together we'll spread the news that God is in our land:

### Verse 3

All praise to the Father, from whom all things come, And all praise to Christ Jesus, His only Son, And all praise to the Spirit who makes us one:
