# 476 - Lead Me To Some Soul Today

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lead me to some soul today, O teach me, Lord, just what to say; Friends of mine are lost in sin, And cannot find their way.

### Verse 2

Lead me to some wayward soul, To one who's wandered from the fold; Help me turn him unto Thee, Thy blessings to behold.

### Verse 3

Lead me from selfrighteousness, May Christ always be seen in me; How can I do any less Than lead more souls to Thee?

### Verse 4

Open hearts of those I love, To hear and heed the gospel call; May they start to heav'n above, And may they never fall.

### Chorus

Few there are who seem to care, And few there are who pray Melt my heart and fill my life, Give me one soul today.
