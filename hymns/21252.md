### Verse 1

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.

### Verse 2

Thru many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; 'Twas grace that bro't me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.

### Verse 3

The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.

### Coda

Amen.

### Verse 4

When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun; We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.
