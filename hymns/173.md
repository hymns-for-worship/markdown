## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We gather now on this Lord's day, to eat the bread and drink the cup; remembering the life He gave, in true communion now we sup. Thank you, Lord, you died for me; help me, Lord, to be like Thee.

### Verse 2

We hear by faith the pleading son; "o Father, pass this cup from me, tho not my will, but thine be done." That night in garden's agony. Bless us, Lord, as oft we show sincere faith from here below.

### Verse 3

We share His body and His blood: with quiet heart our mind discerns the Christ whose side flowed crimson flood; His death we show til He returns. Lord, be with us in this place; keep us safely in thy grace.
