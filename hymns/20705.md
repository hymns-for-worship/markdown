## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is One who can heal the diseases of the body. There is One who can heal the diseases of the soul. Others try and pretend that they have this kind of power, but there's no other Name that you really need to know. There is no  other Name, there is no other Name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. Ev'ry tongue will confess the blessed Name of Jesus.

### Verse 2

In the Name of the Lord we  have found complete redemption. In the Name of the Lord we have hope beyond the grave, and there's no other way to be sure we're bound for heaven. There is no other Name with the awesome pow'r to save. There is no  other Name, there is no other Name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. Ev'ry tongue will confess the blessed Name of Jesus.
