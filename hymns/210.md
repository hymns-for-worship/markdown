## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Walking alone at eve and viewing the skies afar, bidding the darkness come to welcome each silver star; I have a great delight in the wonderful scenes above, God in His power and might is showinh His truth and love.

### Verse 2

Sitting alone at eve and dreaming the hour away, watching the shadows falling now at the close of day; God in His mercy comes with His word He is drawing near, spreading His love and truth around me and everywhere.

### Verse 3

Closing my eyes at eve and thinking of heaven's grace, longing to see my Lord, yes, meeting Him face to face; trusting Him as my all wheresoever my footsteps roam, pleading with Him to guide me on to the spirit's home!

### Chorus

O for a home with God, a place in His courts to rest, sure in a safe abode with Jesus and the blest; rest for a weary soul once redeemed by the savior's love, where I'll be true and whole and live with my God above.
