### Verse 1

Happy day, I can say I am truly on my way to serve Jesus for what He's done for me; Happy smile, all the while I can go the other mile, For I know He is watching over me.

### Verse 2

Holy One, God's own Son, Yes, I know the vict'ry's won; Thank You, Jesus, for what You've done for me; Holy plan, saving man, I forever take my stand With the One who gave His dear life for me.
