## Notation

A - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Love for all, and can it be? Can I hope it is for me  I, who strayed so long ago, strayed so far and fell so low?

### Verse 2

I the disobedient child, wayward, passionate, and wild I, who left my father's home, in forbidden ways to roam.

### Verse 3

I, who spurned his loving hold; I who would not be controlled  I who would not hear his call; I the willful prodigal.

### Verse 4

To my father, can I go? At his feet myself I'll throw; in his house there yet may be place, a servant's place for me.

### Verse 5

See! My father waiting stands; see! He reaches out his hands: God is love, I know, I see, love for me  yes, even me.
