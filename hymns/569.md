## Lyrics

### Verse 1

  May the mind of Christ, my Savior, Live in me from day to day, By His love and pow'r controlling All I do and say.

### Verse 2

 May the word of God dwell richly In my heart from hour to hour, So that all may see I triumph Only thru  His pow'r. 

### Verse 3

 May the peace of God, my Father, Rule my life in ev'rything, That I may be calm to comfort Sick and sorrowing. 

### Verse 4

 May the love of Jesus fill me As the waters fill the sea; Him exalting, self abasing, This is victory. 

### Verse 5

 May His beauty rest upon me As I seek the lost to win, And may they forget the channel, Seeing only Him. 

### Coda

Amen.
