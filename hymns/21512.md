## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Praise the LORD! O heav'ns adore Him; Praise Him, angels in the heights; Sun and moon, bow down before Him; Praise Him, shining stars of light. Praise the LORD, for He hath spoken; Worlds His mighty voice obeyed; Laws which never shall be broken For their guidance He has made.

### Verse 2

Praise the LORD, for He is gracious; Never shall His promise fail; God has made His saints victorious; Sin and death shall not prevail. Praise the God of our salvation; Hosts on high, His pow'r proclaim; Heav'n and earth, and all creation, Laud and magnify His name.
