## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O would you be a blessing true, As on thru life you go? Be constant in God's service here, Don't let your light burn low.

### Verse 2

The world is groping in despair, God's love they do not know, So live to guide them to the right, Don't let your light burn low.

### Chorus

Don't let your light burn low,  Don't let your light burn low, Be constant in God's service here, Don't let your light burn low.

### Verse 3

The loving Savior needs your aid, In letting sinners know, Salvation's free, who will may come, Don't let your light burn low.
