## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Life on earth is of few days and full of trouble, But by faith and many pray'rs on bended knee; With the Lord my Helper He wll always be there; I can do all things thru Christ who strengthens me.

### Verse 2

Like a child with faltered steps I struggle daily, So many barriers in my life cause misery. Precious Lord, please take my hand and lead me onward. I can do all things thru Christ who strengthens me.

### Verse 3

I may lack of daily needs and be in wanting, And other days I may abound so graciously; Yet what ever state of life I find myself in, I can do all things thru Christ who strengthens me.

### Verse 4

Like the Savior on the cross in all His suff'ring, My great example I must strive to always be. I can overcome the world and win the battle I can do all things thru Christ who strengthens me.
