### Verse 1

Holy One, O holy One Gracious Lord, Jehovah's Son, Only Master, highest King, Prince of peace, my ev'rything, Lord of mercy, God of care, Willing all Your love to share, How I praise You, thank and bless, Heaven's Sun of righteousness.

### Verse 2

Lord of comfort, truth, and might, Turn my darkness into light; Take away anxiety, May Your peace abide in me. Holy kingdom by Your hand, Refuge for the soul of man, On Yourself, the Rock, secure, It will stand forever sure.

### Verse 3

Lord You keep me day by day, Thru the trials of my way, Helping me to know Your grace, Teaching me Your way to trace. I will meet You one bright day, High above and far away In that haven for the blest, Holy refuge, home of rest!
