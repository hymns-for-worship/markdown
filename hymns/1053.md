### Verse 1

Jesus, You're the sweetest name of all, Jesus, You always hear me when I call; O Jesus, You pick me up each time I fall; You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

### Verse 2

Jesus, how I love to praise Your name, Jesus, You're still the First, the Last, the same; O Jesus, You died and took away my shame; You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

### Verse 3

Jesus, You're the soon and coming King, Jesus, we need the love that You can bring; O Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing: You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
