## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dwell in me, O Son of God; Grant this joy beyond my telling; You, whom heav'n cannot contain, Take my heart to be Your dwelling. Come my King and Deity. Claim Your temple throne in me.

### Verse 2

Work in me, O Son of God; Sanctify my hands for labor. Thru my days, display Your love; Bless my brother and my neighbor. Shine in works that all may see; Glorify Your name in me.

### Verse 3

Speak in me, O Son of God; Thru Your words of truth and reason; Train my lips to teach Your word, Whether in or out of season. Promise, warning, and decree: give them all their voice in me.

### Verse 4

Live in me, O Son of God; Fill me up to Your perfection; Lead me through Your life, Your death; Bring me to Your resurrection. Then, for all eternity, Bid me, "Come and dwell with Me."
