## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I feel the touch of hands so kind and tender, They're leading me in the paths that I must trod; I have no fear when Jesus walks beside me, For I'm sheltered in the arms of God.

### Verse 2

Soon I shall hear the call from feaven's portals "Come home My child, it's the last mile you must trod;"  I'll fall asleep and wake in God's new heaven Sheltered safe within the arms of God.

### Chorus

So let the storms rage high, the dark clouds rise, They won't worry me For I'm sheltered safe within the arms of God He walks with me and naught of earth shall harm me
