## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come to Calv'ry's holy mountain, Sinners ruin'd by the fall; Here a pure and healing fountain Flows to you, to me, to all, In a full, perpetual tide, Open'd when our Savior died.

### Verse 2

Come in poverty and meanness, Come defiled, without, within; From infection and uncleanness, From the leprosy of sin, Wash your robes and make them white: Ye shall walk with God in light.

### Verse 3

Come, in sorrow and contrition, Wounded, impotent, and blind; Here the guilty free remission, Here the troubled peace may find; Health this fountain will restore, He that drinks shall thirst no more.

### Verse 4

He that drinks shall live forever; 'Tis a soul-renewing flood: God is faithful; God will never Break His covenant in blood, Sign'd when our Redeemer died, Seal'd when He was glorified.
