### Verse 1

Come, now is the time to worship. Come, now is the time to give your heart. Come, just as you are to worship. Come, just  as you are before your God. Come. One day ev'ry tongue will confess  You are God. One day ev'ry knee will bow. Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose You now.
