## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God of salvation, You do not change; Thru all creation, You do not change. Stars in their burning, Timelessly turning, Say for our learning: You do not change.

### Verse 2

Constant in favor, You do not change; Tho' we may waver, You do not change. Swiftly You send us Angels to tend us; Sure to defend us, You do not change.

### Verse 3

While days are flying, You do not change; When we are dying, You do not change. Waking or sleeping, Safe is Your keeping; Ending all weeping, You do not change.
