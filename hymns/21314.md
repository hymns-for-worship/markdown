## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is His name. His strength is unchanging, forever the same. His name is exalted; He shatters all wrong. He is my salvation, my strength, and my song. 

### Verse 2

The LORD is a warrior; He drowns all our woes. He parted the waters and swallowed our foes. The horse and its rider He hurled to the sea; His right hand delivers in bold victory. 

### Verse 3

The LORD is a warrior; the nations have heard. They tremble before Him and quake at His word. His dread reputation has brought them dismay; The rulers of darkness have melted away. 

### Verse 9

The LORD is a warrior; His army a throng. No evil can stop Him, no matter how strong. His people will triumph as He leads them in; His reign is forever and ever. Amen.
