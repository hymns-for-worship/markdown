## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, my heav'nly King, loves me I know, Praises to Him I sing, onward I go; Closely to Him I cling, blessings still flow, I love my Savior, too.

### Verse 2

Walking with Him each day, love light doth shine, Doing His will always, never repine; Kneeling to Him I say "Thy will, not mine," I love my Savior, too.

### Verse 3

Happy to serve my friend, lean on His arm, Rapture will never end, nothing alarm; Voices will sweetly blend, under His charm, I love my Savior, too.

### Chorus

I love my Savior, He loves me too; I seek His favor In ev'ry thing I do.
