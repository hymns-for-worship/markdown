## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When death shall come, and come it will, Those left will surely grieve. The parting, if abrupt or still, Is sad for the bereaved.

### Verse 2

Our daily lives are ever changed; We miss the one who's gone; Our daily walks seem dimly strange, Like night before the dawn.

### Verse 3

While we are sad to say goodbye And sorrowful at death, God's peace, transcending ev'ry cry, Bestows eternal breath.

### Verse 4

If one who is departed now Was serving Christ our King, We know that one will be endowed With joys that heaven brings.
