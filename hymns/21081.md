## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Father, help us to discern Each doctrine that we find, And with Berean love for truth, Put on a nobler mind.

### Verse 2

May we receive each word with zeal, As they did long ago, And search the Scriptures day by day To learn if it is so.

### Verse 3

May we, as workmen unashamed, Regard both old and new, And thus present our minds to truth, Our selves, approved to You.
