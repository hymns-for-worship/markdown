## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a home, sweet home, up in heaven; Where Jesus has gone to prepare, In that land that is fairer than crystal; How I long, how I long to be there.

### Verse 2

Jesus came to earth and He suffered; He died upon Calvary's tree; And I know my dear Savior is waiting; Won't you come to Him now and be free?

### Verse 3

O do not delay any longer, But come and accept Him today; For today is the day of salvation, Take the time to believe and obey.

### Verse 4

Jesus promised peace to the weary, A beautiful crown to the blest, Then surrender to Christ our dear Savior; He will bless you with joy and sweet rest.
