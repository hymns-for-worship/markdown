## Notation

F - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O God, who is a God like You? Whose kindness fills the evening sky, At dawn His grace will rise anew, To answer each repentant cry.

### Verse 2

He does not hold His anger long, He tramples our iniquity, And casts the burden of our wrong Into the deepness of the sea.

### Verse 3

Delight yourself within the Lord Who brings your mercy as the light, For He will see all joy restored, To every heart that is contrite.

### Verse 4

O Father, hide Your face from sin, and never let Your grace depart, Renew my spirit deep within, Create in me a purer heart.
