## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Father, watching over me, And leading me thru life, So many times I call to Thee In sorrow, guilt and strife. And faithful, Lord, art Thou nearby To answer ev'ry prayer. Protect me, Lord, lest I deny Our fellowship, Thy care.

### Verse 2

O Father, Thou spared not Thy Son, But bought us with His blood; From many nations, made Thou one United brotherhood. Where'er we gather in His name, A common love we share, At home in distant land, the same Communion ev'rywhere!

### Verse 3

Past children of Thy covenant, From ev'ry age and land, Ascended thru the firmament, And joined a mighty band. One day, we hope to sing with them Thy hymn, composed beyond, And with Thy congregation form An everlasting bond.
