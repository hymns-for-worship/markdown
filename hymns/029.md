## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How good is the God we adore, Our faithful, unchangable Friend, whose love is as great as His pow'r and knows neither measure nor end.

### Verse 2

How boundless the grace He hath shown in giving Himself on the tree for sinners condemned and undone, unworthy of mercy so free!

### Verse 3

How glorious to walk in the light He sendeth from heaven above, to lean on His infinite might and rest in His unfailing love!

### Verse 4

Tis Jesus, the First and the Last, whose Spirit shall guide us safe home; We'll praise Him for all that is past and trust Him for all that's to come.

### Chorus

How great is Thy goodness, O Lord! How grand and how glorious Thy name! In earth and in heaven adored, Redeemer and Savior of men!
