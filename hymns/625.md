## Notation

D - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 One sweetly solemn thought, Comes to me o'er and o'er; Nearer my home today am I Than e'er I've been before.

### Verse 2

 Nearer my Father's house, Where many mansions be; Nearer today, the great white throne, Nearer the crystal sea.

### Verse 3

 Nearer the bound of life, Where burdens are laid down; Nearer to leave the heavy cross, Nearer to gain the crown.

### Verse 4

 Father, perfect my trust, Strengthen my pow'r of faith; Nor let me stand, at last, alone, Upon the shore of death.
