## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sound the battle cry! See, the foe is nigh; Raise the standard high For the Lord; Gird your armor on, Stand firm, ev'ry one, Rest your cause upon His holy Word.

### Verse 2

Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go, While our cause we know Must prevail; Shield and banner bright Gleaming in the light, Battling for the right, we ne'er can fail.

### Verse 3

O! Thou, God of all, Hear us when we call, Help us, one and all, By Thy grace; When the battle's done, And the vict'ry won, May we wear the crown Before Thy face.

### Chorus

Rouse then, soldiers! Rally round the banner! Read, steady, pass the word along; Onward forward, shout aloud, "Hosanna!" Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.
