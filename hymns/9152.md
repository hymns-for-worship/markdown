## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What darkness this while yet 'tis day? What brings this sudden gloom? Whose hand can stay the sun's glad ray, And leave this pall of doom? Who leaves this pall of doom?

### Verse 2

What means this rending of the veil? What tears this woven wall? Who takes away the veil this day, And offers heaven to all? Who offers heaven to all?

### Verse 3

What dreadful trembling of the earth! Where find we firmer ground! Whose hand can make the mountain quake, And splits the rocks around? Who splits the rocks around?

### Verse 4

Whose body that on yonder hill? Oh darkness , this the cause! The soldier said, well hath he said, "The Son of God, this was!" "The Son of God, this was!"
