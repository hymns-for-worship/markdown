## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I want to know who Jesus is so would you please tell me? Let's look into our Bible, it's there for us to read. The book of John says quite a bit about who Jesus is. Now, listen very carefully to what our Jesus says.

### Verse 2

I am the vine that holds you up so you can bear Me fruit. I am the light of all the world that lights the way for you. I am the door that lets you in but keeps the bad guy out. I am the bread of life so you will never hunger now.

### Verse 3

I am the shepherd of My sheep and all My sheep love Me. I am the way, the truth, the life, to heav'n you go through Me. Then Jesus tells us one more thing about just who He is. I am the resurrection, conquered death so you can live.
