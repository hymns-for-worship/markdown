## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord, a great debt I owe Thee today, My gifts could never begin to repay; For countless blessings you've showered on me; I know my deeds just a token would be.

### Verse 2

Your precious blood takes my sin all away, How can I tell what my soul longs to say; Such tender mercy and kindess I see, How could my songs ever magnify Thee?

### Verse 3

For all dear loved ones who gladden each day, The feelings of my heart can't be displayed; All nature's beauty gives glory to Thee, Help me extol all the virtues I see.

### Verse 4

With hope of heaven I'll finish the way, With thankful heart I will faithfully pray; For perfet gifts and all favors to me, I am forever indebted to Thee.

### Chorus

What shall I render, dear Savior divine? No worthy off'ring can I find. Now in Your word the true answer I see: "Take up your cross, and follow me."
