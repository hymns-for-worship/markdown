## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Break Thou the bread of life, Dear Lord, to me, As Thou didst break the loaves Beside the sea; Within the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord; My spirit pants for Thee, O living Word.

### Verse 2

 Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, To me, to me, As Thou didst bless the bread By Galilee; Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall, And I shall find my peace, My All in all. 

### Verse 3

 Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me, Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me; Give me to eat and live With Thee above; Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.
