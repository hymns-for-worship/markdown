## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rest of the weary, Joy of the sad, Hope of the dreary, Light of the glad; Refuge from danger, Strength to the end, Home of the stranger, Savior and Friend.

### Verse 2

Wealth of the giving, Heart of the kind, Breath of the living, Sight of the blind; Path of the lowly, Crown at the end, Bread of the holy, Savior and Friend.

### Verse 3

Song of the sighing, Lamp of the led, Prayer of the dying, Life of the dead; Be my Endeavor, Unto the end, Love me forever, Savior and Friend.
