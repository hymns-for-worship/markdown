### Verse 1

Jesus, Thy Name I love All other names above, Jesus, my Lord: O Thou art all to me; Nothing to please I see, Nothing apart from Thee, Jesus, my Lord.

Thou, blessed Son of God, Hast bought me with Thy blood, Jesus, my Lord: O how great is Thy love, All other loves above, Love that I daily prove, Jesus, my Lord.

When unto Thee I flee, Thou wilt my refuge be, Jesus, my Lord: What need I now to fear, What earthly grief or care, Since Thou art ever near? Jesus, my Lord.
