## Notation

G - 4/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All my hope on God is founded; He doth still my trust renew; Me thru change and chance He guideth, Only good and only true. God unknown, He alone Calls my heart to be His own.

### Verse 2

Pride of man and earthly glory, Sword and crown betray His trust; What with care and toil He buildeth, Tow'r and temple fall to dust. But God's pow'r, hour by hour, Is my temple and my tow'r.

### Verse 3

Daily doth th'Almighty Giver Bounteous gifts on us bestow; His desire our soul delighteth, Pleasure leads us where we go. Love doth stand at His hand; Joy doth wait on His command.

### Verse 4

Still from man to God eternal Sacrifice of praise be done, High above all praises praising For the gift of Christ, His Son. Christ doth call one and all: Ye who follow shall not fall.
