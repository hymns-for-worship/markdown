### Verse 1

Lord, You have givrn us more than we deserve. May we never boast in wealth; just teach us how to serve. Help our hearts be overflowing with a willingness to share. 

### Verse 2

Lord You're our deep desire, our everlasting love. Here we are , please seal our hearts for Thy courts above Use our hands to heal the wounded who just need someone to care. To be more like You is still our constant prayer.

### Verse 3

Lord, Your amazing glory pales the brightest star. No one who is present here, should wonder where where you are. For Your mercy and Your goodness are so vast, beyond compare. To be more like You is still our constant prayer.
