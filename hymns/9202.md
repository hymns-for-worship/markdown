### Verse 1

Lord, we praise Thee for Thy loving care through the long, long night. For Thy guidance we do ask in pray'r on this new day bright. And Lord, forgive our sins. Always closer to Thy love each day. Through Thy Son we pray.

### Verse 2

Give us now our vital, daily bread for our strength this day. Bless the church with Christ, its holy Head. May we never stray. And Lord, forgive our sins. Lead us onward to Thy bode to stay. Through Thy Son we pray.
