## Notation

Bb - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating Wanderers on the mountain astray; "Come unto me," His message repeating, Words of the Master speaking today. 

### Verse 2

 Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus, Souls that are weak, and hearts that are sore; Leading them forth in ways of salvation, Showing the path to life evermore. 

### Verse 3

 Thus I would go on missions of mercy, Following Christ from day unto day; Cheering the faint, and raising the fallen; Pointing the lost to Jesus the way. 

### Chorus

Going a far upon the mountain, Bringing the wand'rer back again, Into the fold of my Redeemer, Jesus the Lamb fofr sinners slain.
