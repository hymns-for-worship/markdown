# 197 - Beautiful Isle Of Somewhere

## Notation

A - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Somewhere the sun is shining, somewhere the songbirds dwell; hush then, thy sad repining, God lives, and all is well.

### Verse 2

Somewhere the day is longer, somewhere the task is done; somewhere the heart is stronger, somewhere the crown is won.

### Verse 3

Somewhere the load is lifted, close by an open gate; somewhere the clouds are rifted, somewhere the angels wait.

### Chorus

Somewhere, beautiful, beautiful isle, beautiful isle of somewhere! Land of the true, where we live anew, beautiful isle of somewhere!
