## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Along gentle pathways of righteousness follow, My spirit and oft' to my Savior I sing. To me hath He spoken, I hear and I answer, Where will I find gladness but there 'neath His wings.

### Verse 2

And why O my Father, why have You so loved me, And how could my soul e'er be worth aught to Thee. And why will I ask? Is it not past perceiving, 'Tis well enough knowing my Lord died for me.

### Verse 3

O solace my own and a a balm for my spirit, Thou blest Rock of ages, Thou shield of my soul.  O love never fading, O joy never ending, And place with Thy children, a place in Thy fold.

### Verse 4

I love the still waters of life You've provided, Where solace prevails oft' as sorrows appear. I love the quiet path where life truly is blooming, Where Jesus seems ever to be oh so near.
