## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Wise men traveling long and far, Sought a king resting 'neath His star; One day they found Him, Gathered around Him, Fell to the ground, O King of Kings!

### Verse 2

Soon in shame was the King adorned, Robed in scarlet and crowned with thorns; Yet was He glor'ious, Suffering for us! O Lord of Lords! O King of Kings!

### Verse 3

To the Ancient of Days He came, Where the kingdom at last He claimed; When heaven crowned Him, Angels around Him Shouted the sounds, "O King of Kings!"

### Coda

King of Kings! King of Kings! Earth and heaven shout and sing! Jesus Christ is King of Kings!
