### Verse 1

Jesus, the very tho't of Thee with sweetness fills my breast; but sweeter far Thy face to see, and in Thy presence rest.

### Verse 2

Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, nor can the mem'ry find a sweeter sound than Thy blest name, O Savior of mankind!

O hope of every contrite heart! O joy of all the meek! To those who fall, how kind Thou art! How good to those who seek!
