## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Do you know my Jesus, Do you know my King? Do you know that Jesus is my ev'rything? He blesses me daily in all tha tI do. His grace hovers o'er me so tender and true.

### Verse 2

Mine is a glad feeling, within my poor soul, When I know His grace doth my spirit enfold. For He is the author of joy and of might. I fear not the darkness for His is my light.

### Verse 3

He lighteth my pathway, Thru grief and thru pain. He dries ev'ry teardrop and joy comes again. My Lord is the pwer that reigns high above, And His is all glory but mine is His love.
