## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will, Tumultuous passions, all be still; Nor let a murm'ring tho't arise; His ways are just, His counsels wise.



### Verse 2

He in the thickest darkness dwells, Performs His work, the cause conceals; And tho' His footsteps are unknown, Judgment and truth support His throne.


### Verse 3

In heav'n and earth, in air and seas, He executes His wise decrees; And by His saints it stands confessed, That what He does is ever best.


### Verse 4

Then, O my soul, submissive wait, With rev'rence bow before His seat; And 'midst the terrors of His rod, Trust in a wise and gracious God.
