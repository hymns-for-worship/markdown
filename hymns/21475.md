### Verse 1

All nations, clap your hands, Let shouts of triumph ring, For mighty over all the lands The Lord Most High is King.


### Verse 2

Above our mighty foes He gave us pow'r to stand, And as our heritage He chose The goodly promised land.

### Verse 3

With shouts ascends our King, With trumpet's stirring call; Praise God, praise God, His praises sing, For God is Lord of all.

### Verse 4

O sing in joyful strains, And make His glory known; God over all the nations reigns, And holy is His throne.

### Verse 5

Our fathers' God to own The kings of earth draw nigh, For none can save but God alone, He is the Lord Most High.
