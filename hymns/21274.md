## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a happy land of promise over in the great beyond, Where the saved of earth shall soon the glory share; Where the souls of men shall enter and live on forevermore, Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

### Verse 2

There the ransomed of all ages will be singing 'round the throne, In that land where no one ever knows a care; And the Christians of all nations will join in the triumph song, Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

### Verse 3

We will hear nobody praying and no mourning in that land, For no burdens there will be for us to bear; All the people will be singing "Glory, glory to the Lamb," Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

### Verse 4

There we'll meet the One who saved us and who kept us by His grace, And who bro't us to that land so bright and fair; We will praise His name forever as we look upon His face. Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

### Chorus

Ev'rybody will be happy over there, over there, We will shout and sing His praises thru the never ending ages, Ev'rybody will be happy, Will be happy over there; We will shout and sing His praise, Ev'rybody will be happy over there.
