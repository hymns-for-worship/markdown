## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There is a green hill far away, Without a city wall, Where our dear Lord was crucified, Who died to save us all.

### Verse 2

 We may not know, we cannot tell What pains He had to bear; But we believe it was for us, He hung and suffered there.

### Verse 3

 He died that we might be forgiv'n, He died to make us good, That we might go at last to heav'n, Saved by His precious blood.

### Verse 4

 O, dearly, dearly has He loved, And we must love Him, too, And trust in His redeeming blood, And try His works to do.
