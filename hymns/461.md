## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amid the changing scenes below, Where many come and many go, My wistful soul will oft cry out For one who stays, who changes not.

### Verse 2

 The years pass on, a shifting train, Of things familiar few remain, How sweet, how comforting the tho't, That one remains who changes not. 

### Verse 3

 As it has been, so will it be Till comes life's final hour for me, Minely is a favored lot, I have a Friend who changes not.

### Chorus

He changes not, Christ changes not! Though I should be by all forgot, He still remains and will remain! My precious Lord who changes not.
