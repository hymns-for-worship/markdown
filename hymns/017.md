## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sun of my soul , Thou Savior dear, it is not night if Thou be near; O may no earthborn cloud arise to hide The from Thy servant's eyes!

### Verse 2

When the soft dews of kindly sleep my wearied eyelids gently steep, be my last tho't, how sweet to rest forever on my Savior's breast.

### Verse 3

Abide with me from morn till eve, for without Thee I cannot live; abide with me when night is nigh, for without Thee I dare not die.

### Verse 4

Come near and bless us when we wake, ere thru the world our way we take; till in the ocean of Thy love, we lose ourselves in heav'n above.
