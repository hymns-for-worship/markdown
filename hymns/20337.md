## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord is my keeper by night and by day. He'll always be near me, if I never stray. His strong arm will lift me from cold miry clay, Then hold me so gently along the rough way.

### Verse 2

To prove His love for me, He gave His own Son; And now thru this Savior a new life's begun. In the strait and the narrow, my course I shall run, With hope I'll endure till my life crown is won. 

### Verse 3

With power He gives, I can battle the foes, And follow His leading wherever He goes. I'll have true contentment and blissful repose, For I'll live in heaven when this life is closed.

### Verse 4

As I live in His way and do trust His great might, I pray  for His guidance to show me the light. When I cross over Jordan, I'll wear robes pure white, And joyfully sing for I've finished my fight.
