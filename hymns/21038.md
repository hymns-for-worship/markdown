# 21038 - MIGHTY ROCK, WHOSE TOWERING FORM

## Notation

A - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Mighty Rock, whose tow'ring form Looks above the frowning storm; Rock amid the desert waste, To Thy shadow now I haste.

### Verse 2

Of the springs that from Thee burst, Let me drink and quench my thirst; Weary, fainting toil oppressed, In Thy shadow let me rest.

### Verse 3

When I near the stream of death, When I feel its chilly breath, Rock where all my hopes abide, In Thy shadow let me hide.

### Chorus

Unto Thee, unto Thee, Precious Savior, now I flee; Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.
