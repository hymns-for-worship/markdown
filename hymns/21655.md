## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Today is the day of salvation. My soul has been cleansed and set free.  I now have a blessed relation With Jesus who suffered for me. I'm buried with Christ my dear Savior; I'm raised now to walk life anew; May others behold my behavior As one who is loyal and true. 


### Verse 2

I'm born of the water and Spirit To enter God's kingdom above; A heavenly home I'll inherit, If I serve my Father in love.  My words can't express how I feel now, His blood on the cross made me whole.  By faith I will always obey Him. God's wonderful grace saved my soul.
