If it's not You, to whom shall we go? For You are our light, our salvation. Yes, You are the Christ, the Son of God. If it's not You, then who?

### Verse 2

If it's not You, to whom shall we go? You're here from the dawn of creation. You came from above, such matchless love. If it's not You, then who?

If it's not You, to whom shall we go? You're helping us thru tribulations. You suffered and died that we might live. If it's not You, then who?
