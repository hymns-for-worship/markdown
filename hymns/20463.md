## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Glory, sing Hallelujah! Sing the gospel call. Sing of our dear Redeemer, Mighty Lord of all. Then some day over yonder, We will sound our cry as we sing hymns of gladness, Yonder by and by.

### Verse 2

Let us sing Hallelujah! Sing the grand old song. Tell the world Jesus cometh, And it won't be long, Till we see Him descending, Wondrous, Majesty! When our souls hear the Master Calling you and me.

### Verse 3

Once again Hallelujah! For the dead shall rise, Then we'll fly to the Master; Lord of earth and skies. Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Scarce can we contain, All the joy, all the gladness, When He comes again.

### Chorus

Sound it clear, sound the message. Let the world resound. Filling souls over yonder, there and all around. Say the Mighty Maser liveth, Reigning high above. Glory, Hallelujah! Praise, O Praise His love!
