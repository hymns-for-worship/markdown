## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There was a time that my Savior came from Glory, As a man, He endured such misery; There were days that my Savior felt so lonely, There were some times that my Jesus cried, There were some times that my Jesus cried.

### Verse 2

There are some times that I start to feel discouraged, There are days that the burdens pain my soul; But I know that my Savior up in Heaven Knows how I feel and He loves me so, Knows how I feel and He loves me so.

### Verse 3

My Savior prayed when His heart bore down with sorrow, He found strength from Jehovah up above; I will call to my Father when I'm weary, He'll lift me up and He'll make me whole, He'll lift me up and He'll make me whole.
