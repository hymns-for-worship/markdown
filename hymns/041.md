## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Fairest Lord Jesus! Ruler of all nature! O Thou of God and man the Son! Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.

### Verse 2

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands, robed in the blooming garb of spring, Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, who makes the woeful heart to sing.

### Verse 3

Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and all the twinkling starry hosts: Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer, than all the angels heav'n can boast.
