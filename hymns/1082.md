### Verse 1

O let the Son of God enfold you With His Spirit and His love, Let Him fill your life and satisfy your soul; O let Him have the things that hold you, and His Spirit, like a dove, Will descend upon your life and make you whole.

### Verse 2

O come and sing this song with gladness As your hearts are filled  with joy, Lift your voice in sweet surrender to His name; O give Him all your tears and sadness, Give Him all your years of pain, And you'll enter into life in Jesus name.

O Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your Lambs, Your Lambs; O Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your lambs.
