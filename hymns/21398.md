## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O the precious love of Jesus, Growing sweeter day by day, Tuning all my heart, so joyous, To a heav'nly melody.

### Verse 2

But we cannot know the fullness Of the Savior's wondrous love, Till we see and know His glory, In the heav'nly home above.

### Verse 3

Come and taste the love of Jesus, At His feet thy burdens lay; Trust Him with thy grief and sorrow, Bear this joyful song away

### Chorus

Christ is precious, Christ is precious; In life's journey He will lead thee; Christ is precious, Christ is precious; He will lead thee all the way.
