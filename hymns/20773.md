## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I thirst me drink from te lifegiving Stream pure water flows over my soul. As I bathe in Your love, send Your rain from above; fall down on me making me whole.

### Verse 2

Like a tree I will be, I will not fear the heat; no worry when drought comes. Comes my way. I will always bear fruit as a sweet gift to You; my branches will reach out in praise.

### Chorus

By the Stream of life I will take my stand, no desert can harm me, no dry weary land. By the Stream forever and ever I'll sing of the Faithful Redeemer, the lifegiving Stream.
