### Verse 1

Here I am O God. I bring this sacrifice, my open heart. I offer up my life. I look to you Lord. Your love that never ends restores me again. 

### Chorus

So I lift my eyes to you Lord. I your strength will I break thru, Lord. Touch me now, let Your love fall down on me. Thru the storm I will hold on, Lord. And by faith I will walk on, Lord. Then I'll see beyond my Calvary on day, And I will be complete in You.
