## Notation

A - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Look away from the cross to the glittering crown, From your cares weary one look away; There's a home for the soul, where no sorrow can come And where pleasures will never decay.

### Verse 2

Tho' the burdens of life may be heavy to bear, And your crosses and trials severe; There's a beautiful hand that is beckoning come And no heartaches and sighings are there.

### Verse 3

Mid the conflicts, the battles, the struggles and strife, Bravely onward your journey pursue; Look away from the cross to the glittering crown That's awaiting in heaven for you.

### Chorus

Look away, look away, From the cross to the glittering crown, Look away, look away, From the cross to the glittering crown. Weary one, look away from the cross to the crown, glittering crown, Weary one, look away from the cross to the crown,
