## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The savior is waiting to enter your heart, why don't you let him come in? there's nothing in this world to keep you apart; what is your answer to him?

### Verse 2

If you'll take one step toward the savior, my friend, you'll find his arms opened wide; receive him and all of your darkness will end, within your heart he'll abide.

### Chorus

Time after time he has waited before, and now he is waiting again to see if you're willing to open the door  o how he wants to come in!
