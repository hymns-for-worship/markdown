## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rushing rivers, mighty mountains, fiery sunserts, singing birda and flo'rs; Mother, father, all my brethren; friends and children; I could go for hours! Food and warmth in home with sorrows few! Seeing,  hearing, feeling, thinking too! FAITH, HOPE, LOVE, PEACE JOY AND LIFE... Here are the many reasons I love my Lord!

### Verse 2

Holy scriptures, pray'r, forgiveness, angels, heaven, my eternal soul! Preachers, prophets, and apostles; teaching man and giving  him a goal! Jesus as my pattern ev'ry day, tells me how to live and what to say! CRYING, DYING SON OF GOD… Here are the many reasons I love my Lord!
