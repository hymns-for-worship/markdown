### Verse 1

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good cour-age; Your mighty Defender is always the same. Mount up with wings, as the ea-gle ascending; Vict'ry is sure when you call on His name.

### Verse 2

So put on the armor the Lord has provided, And place your defense in His unfailing care. Trust Him for He will be with you in battle, Lighting your path to avoid ev-'ry snare.

### Verse 3

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage; Your mighty Commander will vanquish the foe. Fear not the battle for the vict'ry is always His; He will protect you wherever you go.

### Chorus

Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord; And be of good courage, for He is your guide. Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord; And rejoice for the vict'ry is yours.
