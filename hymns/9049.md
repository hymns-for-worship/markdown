## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Would you be a sunbeam filled with heaven's light, Shedding forth its beauty over scenes of night? In this world of sorrow, sickness, sin, and woe, Try to be a blessing ev'rywhere you go.

### Verse 2

Where the tears are falling and the hearts are sad, Take some gospel message that will make them glad; Strive to give them comfot by some loving deed, Try to be a blessing in the time of need.

### Verse 3

Just a cup of water for the Master's sake May sweet chords of music in some bosom wake; Seek to help some pilgrim toward the golden land, Try to be a blessing both with voice and hand.

### Verse 4

If you follow Jesus all alonglife's way You will help to brighten ev'ry hour and day; Would you shine in glory brighter than the sun? Try to be a blessing till your work is done.

### Chorus

Be a cheerful blessing on life's weary mile, Be a blessing with a word or smile, Be a constant blessing ev'rywhere the same, Try to be a blessing in the Maser's Name.
