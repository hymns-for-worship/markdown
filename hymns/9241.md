## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We train our young to know God's word, And teach them as they grow; To search the scriptures day by day For precepts they must know. When trials come to test their faith The truth will stand alone; Their hearts and minds will grow into A faith to call their own.

### Verse 2

In coming years the saints mature With Satan they must fight. The Law of God will be their guide, and give them strength and might. With faith and courage to stand fast They hold on one by one. Praise God, for in their youth they gained A faith to call their own.

### Verse 3

As young adults advance in years With knowledge by their side; They teach the young to know their God, For Him to be their Guide. They share the wisdom they have gained, ,The way that they have known; So young ones learn to grow and build A faith to call their own.
