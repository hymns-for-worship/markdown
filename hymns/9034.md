### Verse 1

My Friend is good and kind to me. He loved me with His life. He died for me upon that tree, that I might win the strife.

### Verse 2

My Friend is with  me when I fall. He's there to set me right. He shows the way for ev'ry day. He guides me to the light. 

### Verse 3

My Friend is blessing me each day. He gives me what I need. I love Him so, I'll ne'er let go. His word I'll always heed.

### Verse 4

My Friend will one day take me home to live with Him on high. I'll serve Him strong and sing His song until that day arrives.
