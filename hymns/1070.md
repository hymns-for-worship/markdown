# 1070 - Mansion Over The Hilltop

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 3+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm satisfied wth just a cottage below, A little silver and a little gold; But in that city where the ransomed will shine, I want a gold one that's silver lined.

### Verse 2

Don't think me poor or deserted and lonely, I'm not discouraged, I'm heaven bound; I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city, I want a mansion a robe and a crown.

### Chorus

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop, In that bright land where we'll never grow old; And some day yonder we will never more wander But walk the street that is purest gold.
