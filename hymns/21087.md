### Verse 1

Amazing love, How great thy pow'r, It taught my heart to fear; I once was bound, but now, I'm free, Thru His grace, His love set me free. God's amazing love, redeeming love, Great Thy saving pow'r, pow'r, Thy saving pow'r, Taught me how to fear, heart, my trusting heart, Taught me how to love and fear; Once my soul was bound, bound, but now I'm free, now the light I see, I'm so glad and free, God's amazing grace, wondrous love has set me free, His love has set me free.

### Verse 2

God's love and grace, Shall be my theme, Till I reach my sweet home; We'll sing God's praise on heaven's shore, Where we'll live and love evermore. God's amazing love, His amazing grace, It shall always be, be my greatest theme, I shall reach my home, my eternal home, Till I reach my home, sweet home; Sing, forever sing, we will sing His praise, heaven's golden shore, happy golden shore, live, forever live, Where we'll love forevermore, we'll love forevermore.

### Chorus

God's amazing love, His redeeming love, O, how sweet the sound, sweet and clear the sound, Saved a soul like me, sinful soul like me, washed and made my spirit free. Amazing love, has lifted me; I was blind, but now I can see. Amazing love, how sweet the sound, That saved a soul like me; God's amazing love, redeeming love, lifted even me, set me glad and free; Once my eyes were blind, now my eyes can clearly see, my eyes can clearly see.
