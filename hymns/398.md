## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I will sing of my Redeemer, And His wondrous love to me; On the cruel cross He suffered, From the curse to set me free.

### Verse 2

 I will tell the wondrous story, How my lost estate to save, In His boundless love and mercy, He the ransom freely gave.

### Verse 3

 I will sing of my Redeemer, And His heav'nly love to me; He from death to life hath bro't me, Son of God with Him to be. 

### Chorus

Sing, O, sing of my Redeemer, With His blood He purchased me. On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free.
