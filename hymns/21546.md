## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord's our rock, in Him we hide, A shelter in the time of storm; Secure whatever ill betide, A shelter in the time of storm.


### Verse 2

A shade by day, defense by night, A shelter in the time of storm; No fears alarm, no foes affright, A shelter in the time of storm.

### Verse 3

The raging storms may round us beat, A shelter in the time of storm; We'll never leave our safe retreat, A shelter in the time of storm.


### Verse 4

O Rock divine, O Refuge dear, A shelter in the time of storm; Be Thou our helper ever near, A shelter in the time of storm.


### Chorus

O, Jesus is a rock in a weary land, A weary land, a weary land; Jesus is a rock in a weary land, A shelter in the time of storm.
