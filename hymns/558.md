# 558 - Sweeter As The Years Go By

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Of Jesus' love that sought me, When I was lost in sin; Of wondrous grace that brought me Back to His fold again; Of heights and depths of mercy, Far deeper than the sea; And higher than the heavens, My theme shall ever be. 

### Verse 2

 He trod in old Judea Life's pathway long ago, The people thronged about Him, His saving grace to know; He healed the broken hearted, And caused the blind to see; And still His great heart yearneth In love for even me. 

### Verse 3

 'Twas wondrous love which led Him For us to suffer loss, To bear without a murmur The anguish of the cross; With saints redeemed in glory Let us our voices raise, Till heav'n and earth reecho With our Redeemer's praise. 

### Chorus

Sweeter as the years go by, Sweeter as the years go by, Richer, fuller, deeper, Jesus' love is sweeter, Sweeter as the years go by.
