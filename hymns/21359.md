## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Come, ye sinners, poor and needy, Weak and wounded, sick and sore; Jesus ready stands to save you, Full of pity, love, and pow'r. He is able, He is able, He is willing: doubt no more. He is able, He is able, He is willing: doubt no more.

### Verse 2

Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome, God's free bounty glorify; True belief and true repentance, Ev'ry grace that brings us nigh, Without money, without money; Come to Jesus Christ and buy. Without money, without money; Come to Jesus Christ and buy. 

### Verse 3

Come, ye weary, heavy laden, Bruised and broken, full of sin; If you tarry, till you're better, You may never enter in: Not the righteous, not the righteous; Sinners Jesus come to win. Not the righteous, not the righteous; Sinners Jesus come to win.
