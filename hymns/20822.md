## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Today is the day of salvation, Tomorrow may be too late. There's danger and death in delaying, Accept God's saving grace; His life on the cross He has given, O come while yet you may, Give jesus your life and thus walk in His way, Tomorrow may be too late.

### Verse 2

Today is the day of salvation, Tomorrow may be too late. The judgement day, brother, is coming, Prepare ye for that day; His pardon and mercy He offers, Obey while yet you may, He'll save you from sin and bring sweet peace within, Tomorrow may be too late.

### Verse 3

Today is the day of salvation, Tomorrow may be too late. A home up in heaven is waiting, O make the start today; Repent and confess and be baptized, There is no other way, Give Jesus your life and thus walk in His way, Tomorrow may be too late.
