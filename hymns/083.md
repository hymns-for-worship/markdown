## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me. Lest by base denial, I depart from Thee. When Thou see'st me waver with a look recall, nor fear or favor suffer me to fall.

### Verse 2

With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm; or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm; bring to my remembrence sad Gethsemane, or, in darker semblence, crosscrown'd Calvary.

### Verse 3

Should Thy mercy send me sorrow toil and woe; or should pain attend me on my path below; grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see, grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
