# 21062 - SHALL I BE ASHAMED

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Shall I be ashamed of my Savior and King, Who left His bright glory, salvation to bring? Who was cruelly crucified, wounded, and maimed Of such a great Savior shall I be ashamed?

### Verse 2

Shall I be ashamed of His wonderful Word? Or blush when the praises of Jesus are heard? Shall the laugh of the skeptic my lips tightly seal, Lest I my profession of Christ should reveal?

### Verse 3

I'll not be ashamed of my dear loving Lord, Ashamed of His people, His cause, or His Word; I'll be faithful in Jesus, His banner I'll bear, The joy of His kingdom forever to share.

### Chorus

No, no! I'll not be ashamed; No, no! I'll not be ashamed.
