## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Is it like the scripture readeth? Is there life beyond the sea? Is there such a place as Heaven, Where my loved ones wait for me? Is there place prepared and ready, Where no sorrows can invade? Where no grief will e'er assail me, Making me to be afraid?



### Verse 2

Must I ask or even wonder, That His truths are mine to know? Yes, to know, to know and follow, Keeping them wheree'er I go. Should my soul be ever doubting? Make me once again to see. Make me stand again reminded, 'Twas my Lord who died for me. 



### Verse 3

Fear and grief can never follow, Reaching Jordan's other side. For the truths that God has written Are the truths that e'er abide. When my days are turned to moments And my time is almost past, Make me know Thy truths still linger, Tho' my days may cease to last.
