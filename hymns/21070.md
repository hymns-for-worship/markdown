## Notation

Gm - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Not a step will I take without Jesus, Is the vow that my heart has made; Tho' I often am tempted to leave Him, Yet unto Him my heart is stayed.

### Verse 2

Not a step will I take without Jesus, As I travel upon life's way; Tho' temptations may be all around me, I will follow my Lord each day.

### Verse 3

Not a step will I take without Jesus, Where He leads I can never stray, From the path that will lead me to glory, To that land of eternal day.

### Chorus

Not a step will I take, Not a step without Him will I go; He will lead me along, To that beautiful home over there.
