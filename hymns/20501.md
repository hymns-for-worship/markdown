## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I dreamed I went to that city called Glory, So bright and so fair. When I entered the gate I cried, "Holy!" The angels all met me there. They showed me from mansion to mansion, And O, the sights I saw. But I said, "I want to see Jesus, The One who died for all."

### Verse 2

I tho't when I entered that city, My friends knew me well, They showed me all thru heaven; The scenes are too num'rous to tell. They showed me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Mark, Luke, and Timothy. But I said, 'I want to give praise to the One who died for me."

### Verse 3

I tho't when I saw my Savior, O! Glory to God! I just fell right down before Him, singing, "Praise to the name of the Lord!" I bowed down and worshipped Jehovah, My friend of calvary; For I wanted to give praise to Jesus, For saving a sinner like me.

### Chorus

Then I bowed on  my knees and cried, "Holy, Holy, Holy." I clapped my hands and sang "Glory, Glory to the Son of God."
