## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sing to the Lord in a newly made song, Sing to the Lord, all the earth, Sing to the Lord, bless His marvelous name, Shout His good tidings with all mirth. Tell of His glory among ev'ry race, Praise Him within ev'ry land; Though other gods have no power nor life, He raised the heavens with His hand.

### Verse 2

Give to the Lord O you fam'lies of men, Give to the Lord praise and might, Give to the Lord all the praise due His name, Offer Him all you know 'tis right. Worship the Lord in pure splendor alone, Tremble, both aged and all youth, Say to the nations "The Lord firmly reigns, Judging the peoples with His truth."

### Verse 3

Let the skies shout, let the dry land rejoice, Let the sea roar and the coast, Let the field sing, and with all it contains, And all the forests then will boast. All will exult, for the Lord is at hand, Coming to judge all the earth, Righteously judging the world and its folk, Faithfully trying all their worth.
