## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When we reach that home and lay our burden down, God shall wipe away all tears; when we join the saints and wear a robe and crown, God shall wipe away all tears.

### Verse 2

When the pearly gates unfold for you and me, God shall wipe away all tears; when we see the Christ who set the captive free, God shall wipe away all tears.

### Verse 3

When we sweetly sing with all that ransomed throng, God shall wipe away all tears; no more partings come to mar that happy song, God shall wipe away all tears.

### Chorus

God shall wipe away all the tears from every eye, give us joys for all aur fears; when we meet him in that home beyond the sky, God shall wipe away all tears.
