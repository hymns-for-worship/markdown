## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Out of the depths I cry to You on high: Lord, hear my call. Bend down Your ear and listen to my sigh, forgiving all. If You should mark our sins, who then could stand? But grace and mercy dwell at Your right hand.

### Verse 2

I wait for God, I trust His holy Word; He hears my sighs. My soul still waits and looks unto the Lord; my pray'rs arise. I look for Him to drive away my night Yes, more than those who watch for morning light.

### Verse 3

Hope in the Lord: unfailing is His love; in Him confide. Mercy and full redemption from above He does provide. From sin and evil, mighty tho' they seem, His arm almighty will His saints redeem.
