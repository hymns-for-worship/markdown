## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Only in Thee, O Savior mine, dwelleth my soul in peace divine, peace that the world, tho' all combine, never can take from me. Pleasures of earth so seemingly sweet, fail at the last my longing to meet; only in Thee my bliss is complete, only, dear Lord, in Thee!

### Verse 2

Only in Thee a radiance bright, shines like a beacon in the night, guiding my pilgrim bark aright, over life's trackless sea. Only in Thee, when troubles molest, when with temptation I am oppressed; there is a sweet pavillion of rest, only, dear Lord, in Thee!

### Verse 3

Only in Thee, dear Savior, slain, losing Thy life my own to gain, trusting, I'm cleansed from every stain; Thou art my only plea. Only in Thee, my heart will delight, till in that land where cometh no night, faith will be lost in heavenly sight, only, dear Lord, in Thee!
