## Notation

F - 3/4 on 2+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You  made my soul before my birth; My mother's womb, its hiding place, And in Your image gave me life. Each waking morn You're still with me.

### Verse 2

You search me, Lord, and know me well When I sit down and when I rise. Before I speak You know my words, Your knowledge is too great for me! 

### Verse 3

Lord, where I go Your Spirit is; If to the sky then You are there. If in the deep where spirits dwell, Your hand will guide and comfort me.

### Chorus

And if I rise on wings of dawn, Or settle far across the sea, You'll see me there, and with Your hand, You'll draw me closer to Your heart.
