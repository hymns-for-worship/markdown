## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Now rest beneath night's shadow The woodland, field and meadow: The world in slumber lies; But thou, my heart, awake thee, To prayer and song betake thee, Let praise to thy Creator rise.



### Verse 2

Lord Jesus, who does love me, O spread Thy wings above me, And shield me from alarm; Tho' Satan would devour me, Let angelguards sing o'er me: "This child of God shall meet no harm."
