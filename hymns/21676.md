# 21676 - HYPOCRISY

## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 12 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"I believe" does not count if you do not mean it. You may boast as the Pharisees did Or mean it by heart as true foll'wers of God.









### Verse 2

"I have faith" does not count if you do not mean it. God sees past what is on the outside And looks underneath into ev'ryone's heart.

### Verse 3

Hypocrites look alive but are dead at heart. Truly you must believe and have faith, Not just on the outside, but inside, too.
