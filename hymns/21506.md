## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, help me to be like young David, who willing to fight for a cause, went to battle the giant Goliath with no thought of question or pause.

### Verse 2

When his brothers all turned against him, and King Saul declared him unknown; determined he took up his weapons: no sword, just a sling and smooth stones. "I come in the name of the Lord of hosts! The armies of God you defy! This day will the Lord give you into my hand!" The battlefield words loudly cried.


### Verse 3

The stone thrown in faith from the simple sling from the man "after God's own heart" proved there is a God in Israel; The battle was Yours from the start.  "I come in the name of the Lord of hosts! The armies of God you defy! This day will the Lord give you into my hand!" These battle field words I will cry!

### Verse 4

The stone thrown in faith from my simple sling like the man "after God's own heart" proves You are the God of Israel; The battle is Yours from the start.
