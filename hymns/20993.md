### Verse 1

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven, To His feet your tribute bring; Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing. Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise the everlasting King!

### Verse 2

Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress; Praise Him, still the same as ever, Slow to chide and swift to bless. Alleluia! Alleluia! Glorious is His faithfulness!

### Verse 3

Fatherlike, He tends and spares us; Well our feeble frame He knows, In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes. Alleluia! Alleluia! Widely yet His mercy flows!

### Verse 4

Angels in the height, adore Him, You behold Him face to face; Saints triumphant, bow before Him; Gathered in from ev'ry race. Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise with us the God of grace!
