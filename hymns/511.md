## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Let us hold within us still, Visions of dark Calv'ry's hill, Where my Lord was led to die, Where my Lord was lifted high.

### Verse 2

 Memories we keep of Thee, Precious One that made us free; Lord of love and Lord of light, Son of God who knows no night.

### Verse 3

 Worthy One, O glorious King, With Thy praise all heaven rings; Awesome host with sweetest lays, Never cease to give Thee praise.
