## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Speak, Lord, in the stillness While I wait on Thee; Hushed my heart to listen In expectancy.

### Verse 2

 Speak, O blessed Master, In this quiet hour; Let me see Thy face, Lord, Feel Thy touch of pow'r.

### Verse 3

 For the words Thou speakest, They are life indeed; Living bread from heaven, Now my spirit feed!

### Verse 4

 All to Thee is yielded, I am not my own; Blissful, glad surrender, I am Thine alone.

Amen.
