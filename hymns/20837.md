## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, I care not for riches, Neither silver nor gold; I would be sure of heaven, I would enter the fold, In the book of Thy kingdom, With its page white and fair, Tell me, jesus, my Savior, Is my name written there?

### Verse 2

Lord, my sins they are many, Like the sands of the sea, But Thy blood, O, my Savior, Is sufficient for me; For Thy promise is written, In bright letters that glow, "Tho' your sins be as scarlet, I will make them like snow."

### Verse 3

O! that beautiful city, With its mansions of light, With its glorified beings, In pure garments of white; Where no evil things cometh, To despoil what is fair; Where the angels are watching, Is my name written there?



### Chorus

Is my name written there, On the page white and fair? In the book of thy kingdom, Is my name written there?
