## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Life was shattered and hope was gone, Crushing the load that I bore; Then out of the depths I cried, "O God, Please give me something worth living for."

### Verse 2

 O the joy of sins forgiv'n, Nothing's the same as before; My life overflows since Jesus came And gave me something worth living for. 

### Chorus

Something more than my yesterdays, More thn I had before, Something more than wealth or fame, He gave me something worth living for.
