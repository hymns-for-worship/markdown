## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Little children, from above, Sent to us with joy and love, Bring a hope so clear and bright, Father, help us raise them right.

### Verse 2

O how tender is the sight: little ones in bed at night, Parents praying at their feet, "Father, keep them pure and sweet."

### Verse 3

Little children soon are grown; Can they face the world alone? As they strive and struggle thru, Father, let them turn to You.

### Verse 4

When our time to go draws near,  We may leave our children here; To the new land, far away, Father, bring them home some day.
