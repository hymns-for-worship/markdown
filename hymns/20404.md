## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Light of day, Milky Way, Heaven's glory and honor, Northern lights, moon so bright: All give paise to my God!

### Verse 2

Evergreens, crystal streams, Peaks of Kilimanjaro, Deep blue sky, rocks that cry: All give praise to my God!

### Verse 3

Songs of praise, hands that raise, Hearts committed forever, Come and see why we'll be giving praise to my God!

### Chorus

And the angels sing praise to the Lord, And the angels give thanks to the Lord, All the heavens sing out the song of Moses and the Lamb, the Alpha and Omega, I AM!
