## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am going to a city where the streets of gold are laid, where the tree of life is blooming, and the roses never fade.

### Verse 2

In this world we have our troubles, Satan's snares we must evade; we'll be free from all temptations where the roses never fade.

### Verse 3

Saved ones gone to be with Jesus, in their robes of white arrayed, now are waiting for my coming where the roses never fade.

### Chorus

Here they bloom but for a season, soon their beauty is decayed; I am going to a city where the roses never fade.
