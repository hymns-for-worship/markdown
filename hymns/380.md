## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 It won't be very long till this short life shall end, It won't be very long till Jesus shall descend; And then the dead in Christ from beds of clay shall rise To meet the Lord and King up yonder in the skies. 

### Verse 2

 It won't be very long till here we cease to roam, It won't be very long till all the saints get home; And then with smiling face we'll walk the street of gold, And sing the Savior's praise where saints are never old. 

### Verse 3

 It won't be very long till earth shall pass away, It won't be very long till works of men decay; But Jesus has prepared a happy dwelling place, For all who look above and trust His matchless grace.

### Chorus

It won't be very long It won't be very long Till Jesus shall appear, That day is drawing near; Will you be ready then To meet the ransomed throng? Get ready for that day, It won't be very long.
