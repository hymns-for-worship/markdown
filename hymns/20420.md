## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, innocent and holy, undefiled, our Priest most high. In obedience once most lowly, yet exalted to the sky.

### Verse 2

He was born to lamentation and made whole in suffering; Now He leads us to salvation, merciful in ev'rything.

### Verse 3

Since He tasted our condition, He will surely intercede; Let us bring then our petitions to our God in time of need.
