## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O worship the King, all glorious above, and greatfully sing His wonderful love; our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days, Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.

### Verse 2

Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, and sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

### Verse 3

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, in Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail; Thy mercies, how tender! How firm to the end! Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!
