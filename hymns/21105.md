## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When before the Lord I'm standing, O how sweet His voice will be. As I hear Him gently calling, Come, ye blessed, unto Me.

### Verse 2

What a thrill to sing God's praises, when His face at last I see. With redeemed of all the ages and my Savior I will be.

### Verse 3

In this vale of tears I'm waiting for God's call to set me free. I'll obey His blest commandments, then the tree of life I'll see.

### Verse 4

What a precious invitation, where no sin will ever be. How I'm longing for His welcome, Come, ye blessed, home with Me.

### Chorus

Come, ye blessed, come, ye blessed, into the joy of the Lord. Come, ye blessed, of my Father, Heaven's treasures, your reward.
