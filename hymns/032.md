## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Awake, my tongue, thy tribute bring to Him who gave thee pow'r to sing; praise Him who is all praise above, the source of wisdom and of love.

### Verse 2

How vast His knowledge! How profound! A deep where all our tho'ts are drowned; the stars He numbers and their names He gives to all those heav'nly flames.

### Verse 3

Thro' each bright world above, behold, ten thousand thousand charms unfold; earth, air, and mighty seas combine to speak His wisdom all divine.

### Verse 4

But in redemption, o what grace! Its wonders, o what tho't can trace! Here wisdom shines forever bright: praise Him, my soul, with sweet delight.
