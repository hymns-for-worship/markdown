## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of heaven breaks; the summer morn I've sighed for, the fair, sweet morn awakes; dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring is at hand, and glory, glory dwelleth in immanuel's land.

### Verse 2

O christ, he is the fountain, the deep sweet well of love; the streams on earth I've tasted, more deep I'll drink above; there to an ocean fullness his mercy doth expand, and glory, glory dwelleth, in immanuel's land.

### Verse 3

The king there in his beauty without a veil is seen; it were a wellspent journey, tho seven deaths lay between; the lamb with his fair army doth on mount zion stand, and glory, glory dwelleth in immanuel's land.
