## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If the dark shadows gather As you go along, Do not grieve for their coming;  Sing a cheery song. There is joy for the taking; It will soon be light, Ev'ry cloud wears a rainbow, If your heart keeps right.



### Verse 2

Is your life just a tangle Full of toil and care? Smile a bit as you journey, Others’ burdens share; You’ll forget all your troubles, Making their lives bright. Skies will grow blue and sunny, If your heart keeps right.


### Verse 3

There are blossoms of gladness, ’Neath the winter’s snow; From the gloom and the darkness, Comes the morning glow. Never give up the battle, You will win the fight; Gain the rest of the Victor, If your heart keeps right.


### Chorus

If your heart keeps right, If your heart keeps right, There's a song of gladness in the darkest night; If your heart keeps right, If your heart keeps right, Ev'ry cloud will wear a rainbow, If your heart keeps right.
