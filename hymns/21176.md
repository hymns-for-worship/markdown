# 21176 - A PURPLE ROBE, A CROWN OF THORN

## Notation

F - 6/8 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A purple robe, a crown of thorn, a reed in His right hand; Before the soldiers' spite and scorn I see my Savior stand. He bears between the Roman guard the weight of all our woe; A stumbling figure bowed and scarred I see my Savior go.

### Verse 2

He hangs, by whom the world was made, Beneath the darkened sky; The everlasting ransom paid, I see my Savior die. He shares on high His Father's throne, Who once in mercy came; For all His love to sinners shown I sing my Savior's name.
