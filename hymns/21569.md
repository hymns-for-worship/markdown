# 21569 - MY ANCHOR HOLDS

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tho' the angry surges roll On my tempestdriven soul, I am peaceful, for I know, Wildly tho' the winds may blow, I've an anchor safe and sure, That can evermore endure.

### Verse 2

Mighty tides about me sweep, Perils lurk within the deep, Angry clouds o'ershade the sky, and the tempest rises high; Still I stand the tempest's shock, For my anchor grips the rock.

### Verse 3

I can feel the anchor fast As I meet each sudden blast And the cable, tho' unseen, Bears the heavy strain between; Thru the storm I safely ride, Till the turning of the tide.

### Verse 4

Troubles almost 'whelm the soul; Griefs like billows o'er me roll; Tempters seek to lure astray; Storms obscure the light of day: But in Christ I can be bold, I've an anchor that shall hold.


### Chorus

And it holds, my anchor holds; Blow your wildest, then, O gale, On my bark so small and frail: By His grace I shall not fail, For my anchor holds, my anchor holds.
