## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hark! The herald angels sing, "glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinner reconciled!" Joyful, all ye nations, rise; join the triumph of the skies; with the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem! With the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem!

### Verse 2

Mild, he lays His glory by, born that man no more may die; born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; hail the incarnate Deity; pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel! Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel!

### Verse 3

Hail the heav'nborn Prince of Peace! Hail the Son of Righteousness! Light and life to all He brings, ris'n with healing in His wings. Christ, by highest heav'n adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord; come, desire of nations, come, fix in us Thy humble home; come, desireof nations, come, fix in us Thy humble home.
