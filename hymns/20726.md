## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light, Like a little candle burning in the night; In this world of darkness we must shine, You in your small corner and I in mine.

### Verse 2

Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light, well He sees and knows it if our light is dim; He looks down from heaven, see us shine, You in your small corner and I in mine.

### Verse 3

Jesus bids us shine, then, for all around. Many kinds of darkness in this world abound: Sin and want and sorrow we must shine, You in your small corner and I in mine.

### Verse 4

Jesus bids us shine as we work for Him, Bringing those that wander from the paths of sin; He will ever  help us, if we shine, You in your small corner and I in  mine.
