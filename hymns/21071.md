## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus is calling, calling, calling, Jesus is calling today; Why should I linger, linger, linger? I will arise and away.

### Verse 2

Jesus is pleading, pleading, pleading, Why should I wander in sin, While to His glory, glory glory, Glad He would welcome me in?

### Verse 3

Jesus is waiting, waiting, waiting, Open now standeth the door; Soon the night falleth, falleth, falleth, Closed are the gates evermore.

### Chorus

They are so happy, happy, happy, Who do their Savior obey: Why should I linger, linger, linger? I will arise and away.
