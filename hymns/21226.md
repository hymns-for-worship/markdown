## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You wash my feet, O Lord, my God? But no! You wash my all! But only when I learn to trust, And heed Your loving call. And now, so clean, my heart can heed Your Holy Spirit's words; I'll be your servant until death, As with Your towel I'm gird.

### Verse 2

O Lord, the peace that fills my heart When I obey Your will; You calm me with Your words of love, And anxious moments still. I long to see that place prepared, Where faithful saints will bask; But may I wash Your servant's feet Until we meet at last!
