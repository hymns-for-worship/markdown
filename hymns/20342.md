## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Flee as a bird to your mountain, Thou who art weary of sin; Go to the clear flowing fountain, Where you may wash and be clean. Fly, for th'a venger is near thee; Call and the Savior will hear thee; He on His bosom will bear  thee, O thou who art weary of sin, O thou who art weary of sin.

### Verse 2

He will protect thee forever, Wipe ev'ry falling tear; He will forsake thee, O never, Sheltered so tenderly there. Haste, then, the hours are flying, Spend not the moments in sighing, Cease from your sorrow and crying; The Savior will wipe ev'ry tear, The Savior will wipe ev'ry tear.
