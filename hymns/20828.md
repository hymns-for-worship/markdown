# 20828 - MY FAITH HAS FOUND A RESTING PLACE

## Notation

G - 3/2 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My faith has found a resting place, Not in a manmade creed: I trust the ever living One, That He for me will plead.

### Verse 2

Enough for me that Jesus saves: This ends my fear and doubt. A sinful soul I come to Him, He will not cast me out.

### Verse 3

My soul is resting on the Word, The living Word of God, Salvation in my Savior's name, Salvation thru His blood.

### Verse 4

The great Physician heals the sick; The lost He came to save. For me His precious blood He shed, For me His life He gave.

### Chorus

I need no other argument, I need no other plea; It is enough that Jesus died And rose again for me
