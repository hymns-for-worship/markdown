## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 It was matchless love that found me, When the bands of sin had bound me, It was love that planned escape for me When I was lost, undone; It was love in sad plight, saw me, It was love that reached out for me, 'Twas the precious love of Jesus Christ The mighty, holy One. 

### Verse 2

 What a tender lovingkindness, That sought me in my blindness, And a marvelous redemption wro't That mortals might be free! What an act in its completeness! What a love in tender sweetness! What a wonderful salvation now Abounds for you and me. 

### Verse 3

 What a wonderful relation That I, in lowly station, Am called a "son unto God," what more Could human heart desire? By His tender love o'ershaded, I'll be kept till earth has faded From my sight, and I shall enter in To join the heav'nly choir. 

### Chorus

'Twas love, 'Twas matchless love, That caused my Savior there, Upon the cruel cross to choose A death of shame for even me; How can I e'er repay The debt of love I owe, For His salvation full and free, Giv'n thru love, wonderful love, matchless love?
