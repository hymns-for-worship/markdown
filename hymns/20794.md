## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing; He chastens and hasyens His will to make known; The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing; Sing praises to His Name, He fails not His own!

### Verse 2

Beside us to guide us our God with us joining, Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine; So from the beginning the fight we were winning: Lord, Thine be all the glory, The vict'ry is Thine

### Verse 3

We all do extol Thee , Thou King of the nation, And pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be; May Thy congregation escape tribulation: Be Thou for ever praised, Thou God of the free!
