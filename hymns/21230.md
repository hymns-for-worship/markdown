## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some call it heaven, I call it home. The place I long for, there 'round God's throne. Love, joy and singing, no more alone. Some call it heaven, I call it home. This pilgrim journey on earth below Cannot compare with the joy we'll know. Sweet mem'ries urge me on to that land. When will I know such comfort again?

### Verse 2

Some call it heaven, I call it home. The place I long for, there 'round God's throne. Love, joy and singing, no more alone. Some call it heaven, I call it home. I close my eyes and I see a place No pain, no worries singing God's praise. And in His hands I'm ever secure. Home everlasting, I am assured! Some call it heaven, I call it home. The place I long for, there 'round God's throne. Love, joy and singing, no more alone. Some call it heaven, I call it home.
