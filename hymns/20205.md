Come let us sing for joy to the Lord, Let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. Let us come before Him with thanksgiving and extol Him with music and song.

For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods, In His hands are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him. The sea is His, He made it, and His hands formed the dry land. And His hands formed the dry land.
