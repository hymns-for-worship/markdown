## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus keep me near the cross: there a precious fountain, free from all the healing stream, flows from calv'ry's mountain.

### Verse 2

Near the cross, a trembling soul, love and mercy found me; there the bright and morning star sheds its beams around me.

### Verse 3

Near the cross! O lamb of God, bring its scenes before me; help me walk from day to day with its shadows o'er me.

### Verse 4

Near the cross, I'll watch and wait, hoping, trusting, ever, till I reach the golden strand, just beyond the river.

### Chorus

In the cross, in the cross, be my glory ever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.
