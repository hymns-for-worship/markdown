## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I will sing the wondrous story of the christ who died for me, how he left his home in glory for the cross of calvary.

### Verse 2

I was lost but Jesus found me, found the sheep that went astray, threw His loving arms around me, drew me back unto his way.

### Verse 3

He will keep me till the river rolls its waters at my feet; then he'll bear me safely over, where the loved one I shall meet.

### Chorus

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story of the christ who died for me, sing it with the saints in glory, gathered by the crystal sea.
