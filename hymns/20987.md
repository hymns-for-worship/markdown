## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Jesus, how I love You, and I sing out Your name. How could I repay You for the life that You gave. I know that I'm not worthy; a simple sinner like me. But You suffered, bled and died for my sin bitterly.

### Verse 2

O Jesus, how I long to be by Your side. I know there will be no more pain, ev'ry tear will be dry. O then, Lord, I'll fall on my face, and I'll wait for Your hand, To pull me closer, so I can sing for the great I AM.

### Chorus

Jesus, I'm sorry You cried the night in the garden. I did not stand by Your side. Jesus, I'm sorry You died; 'Cause I know my sin cost You Your life.
