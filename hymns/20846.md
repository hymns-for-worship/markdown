# 20846 - I CANNOT FIND THE WAY ALONE

## Notation

G - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As I journey thru this vale of sorrow, The way seems so strange and unknown; Lord, I need a helping hand to borrow, For I cannot find the way alone.

### Verse 2

I have no other friend to guide me And I am so weak and undone; Walk a little closer, Lord, beside me, For I cannot find the way alone.

### Verse 3

When the raging storms of life confound me, Dear Lord, wilt Thou keep me Thine own? Let me feel Thy precious arms around me, For I cannot find the way a-lone.

### Chorus

I cannot find the way without Thee, Dear Lord, look down from Thy throne; And make Thy light to shine about me, For I cannot find the way alone.
