## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Go to dark Gethsemane; You who feel the tempter's pow'r; Your Redeemer's conflict see; Watch with Him one bitter hour; Turn not from His friends away; Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

### Verse 2

Follow to the judgment hall; View the Lord of life arraigned; O, the wormwood and the gall! O, the pangs His soul sustained! Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss; Learn of Him to bear the cross.

### Verse 3

Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb; There, adoring at His feet, Mark that miracle of time, God's own sacrifice complete; "It is finished!" Hear the cry; Learn of Jesus Christ to die.

### Verse 4

Early hasten to the tomb Where they laid His breathless clay; All is solitude and gloom Who hath taken Him away? Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes; Savior, teach us so to rise.
