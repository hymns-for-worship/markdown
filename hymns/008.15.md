### Verse 1

Down at the cross where my Savior died, Down where for cleansing from sin I cried, There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His name.

### Verse 2

I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, There at the cross where He took me in; Glory to His name.

### Verse 3

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet; Cast Thy poor soul at the Savior's feet; Plunge in today and be made complete; glory to His name.

Glory to His name, glory to His name; there to my heart was the blood applied; glory to His name.
