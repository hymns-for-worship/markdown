### Verse 1

Who has the pow'r to raise the dead? Who can save us from our sin? He is our hope, our righteousness: Jesus, only Jesus.

Who can command the highest praise? Who has the name above all names? You stand alone, I stand amazed. Jesus, only Jesus. You will command the highest praise. Yours is the Name above all names. You stand alone, I stand amazed, Jesus, only Jesus. Jesus, only Jesus. Jesus, only Jesus.
