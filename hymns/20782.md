## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The slpendor of a king, clothed in majesty; let all the earth rejoice, He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide; it trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice.

### Verse 2

And age to age He stands and time is in His Hand; beginning and the end, beginning and the end, The God head three in One, Father Spirit Son the Lion and the Lamb.

### Chorus

How great is our God, sing with me how great is our God, and all will see, how great, how great is our God.
