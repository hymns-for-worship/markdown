## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Why should I feel discouraged, Why should the shadows come, Why should my heart be lonely And long for heav'n and home, When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.

### Verse 2

Let not your heart be troubled, His tender words I hear, And resting on His goodness I lose my doubt and fears: Tho' by the path He leadeth But one step I may see: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.

### Verse 3

Whenever I am  tempted, Whenever clouds arise, When songs give place to sighing, When hope within me dies, I draw the closer to Him, From care He sets me free; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He cares for me; His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He cares for me.

### Chorus

I sing because I'm happy,l I sing because I'm free, For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.
