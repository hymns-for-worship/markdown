## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide; It may be in the sunshine that I, in peace, abide; But this one thing I know if it be dark or fair, If Jesus is with me, I'll go anywhere!

### Verse 2

 It may be I must carry the blessed word of life Across the burning deserts to those in sinful strife; And tho' it be my lot to bear my colors there, If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere!

### Verse 3

 It is not mine to question the judgments of the Lord, It is but mine to follow the leadings of His word; But if to go or stay, or whether here or there, I'll be, with my Savior, content anywhere!

### Chorus

If Jesus goes with me, I'll go Anywhere! 'Tis heaven to me, Where e'er I may be, If He is there! I count it a privilege here His cross to bear; If Jesus goes with me, I'll go Anywhere!
