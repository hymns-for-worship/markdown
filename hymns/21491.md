## Notation

Ab - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I count it all joy to suffer for Him, Enduring the pains, the trouble and strife, When I am discouraged, my path growing dim, I think of my Savior's great matchless life.


### Verse 2

Christ hung on the cross at Calvary, Despising the shame and great misery, He endured the suff'ring that we might be free, He gave His own life there for you and me!

### Verse 3

I count it all joy to work for my Lord, Always loy'l and true, His will ever do, Knowing if I'm faithful I'll gain a reward, I'm working for Jesus till life is thru.



### Chorus

I count it all joy when I suffer for Him, when temptations great come troubling my way, He then is my guide, my help and my stay; I count it all pleasure to suffer for Him.
