## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sing, O sing of my Redeemer! With His blood He purchased me. On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free.

### Verse 2

I was lost, but Jesus found me, Found the sheep that went astray, Threw His loving arms around me, Drew me back into His way.

### Verse 3

I'm so glad I learned to trust Him, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; And I know that He is with me, Will be with me to the end.
