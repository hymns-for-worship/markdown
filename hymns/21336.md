## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My treasures here have all faded, familiar things have all changed, And all my hopes have gone upward, in wistful dreams of someday.

### Verse 2

This feeble body will fail me, and all I have will decay, But nothing down here will matter, when I reach heaven someday.

### Chorus

Someday I'll walk on the banks of the river; Someday I'll stand on the street made of gold; Someday I'll drink of the cool living water, in a place where I'll never grow old. Someday I'll sing with the heavenly chorus, sweet songs of praise thru the unending day. Someday I'll bow at the great throne of heaven, and meet my sweet Lord someday!
