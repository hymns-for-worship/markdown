## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Jesus, King most wonderful, Thou Conqueror renowned, Thou Sweetness most ineffable, In whom all joys are found!



### Verse 2

When once Thou visitest the heart, Then truth begins to shine, Then earthly vanities depart, Then kindles love divine.

### Verse 3

Thee may our tongues forever bless; Thee may we love alone: And ever in our lives express the image of Thine own

May ev'ry heart confess Thy Name, And ever Thee adore; And, seeking Thee, itself inflame And see Thee more and more.
