### Verse 1

Savior, lead me lest I stray, gently lead me all the way; I am safe when by Thy side, I would in Thy love abide.

### Verse 2

Thou the refuge of my soul, when life's stormy billows roll; I am safe when Thou art nigh, all my hopes on Thee rely.

### Verse 3

Savior, lead me, then at last, when the storm of life is past; to the land of endless day, where all tears are wiped away.

### Chorus

Lead me, Lead me, Savior, lead me lest I stray; gently down the stream time, lead me, Savior, all the way.
