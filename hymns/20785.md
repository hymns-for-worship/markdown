Let me tell you, tell you, Tell you what my Jesus means to me; Tell you what the Lprd did to sett my heart free. For He gave His love, dying just for me, He has truly given his all for me.

And I praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him for the flow'rs that bloom unseen; Praise Him for the stars that do silently sing. For He gave His love, dying just for me, He has truly given his all for me.
