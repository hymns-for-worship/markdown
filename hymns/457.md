## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If I walk in the pathway of duty, If I work till the close of the day, I shall see the great King in His beauty When I've gone the last mile of the way.

### Verse 2

 If for Christ I proclaim the glad story, If I seek for His sheep gone astray, I am sure He will show me His glory When I've gone the last mile of the way.

### Verse 3

 And if here I have earnestly striven And have tried all His will to obey, 'Twill enhance all the rap-ture of heaven  When I've gone the last mile of the way.

### Chorus

When I've gone the last mile of the way. When I've gone the last mile of the way, I will rest at the close of the day, And I know there are joys that await me
