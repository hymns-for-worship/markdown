## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Each day I live I fail to do the things I know I should. My weakness causes me to stray from doing what I could. I cry, "Dear God, don't let me die in darkness and in sin. Help me in weakness when I fall to find my soul again."

### Verse 2

I see my Savior on the tree. In weakness there He died. But in that hour He bore my sins that I might e'er abide. "Show me the pow'r which Jesus used when weary, tired, and worn. Help me in weakness and in strife His strength e'er to adorn."
