## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My heart bowed down with sin and shame, found peace as pardon came, When I obeyed, the guilt was gone, amazing grace, my song.

### Verse 2

Tho' prodigals reproach His name, the Father waits the same; His precious love will suffer long, e'en tho' they did Him wrong.

### Chorus

I'm forgiven! His blood cleanses me, and if faithful, heav'n I'll see. I’m forgiven! God said before, I'll remember sin no more."

### Verse 3

Christ prayed "forgive them" from his cross, for sins He paid the cost. No doubt will silence this my song. God blots out sin: it's gone.

### Verse 4

For Cod's great mercy, praise His name! His love I will proclaim, I'll tell lost souls that Jesus gave His life, their souls to save.
