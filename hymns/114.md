## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thou, my everlasting portion, more than friend or life to me; all along my pilgrim journey, Savior, let me walk with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee; All along my pilgrim journey, Savior, let me walk with Thee.

### Verse 2

Not for ease or wordly pleasure, nor for fame my prayer shall be; gladly will I toil and suffer, only let me walk with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee; gladly will I toil and suffer, only let me walk with Thee. 

### Verse 3

Lead me thru the vale of shadows, bear me o'er life's fitful sea; then the gate of life eternal may I enter, Lord with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee; then the gate of life eternal may I enter, Lord with Thee. 

### Chorus

Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee; all along my pilgrim journey, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
