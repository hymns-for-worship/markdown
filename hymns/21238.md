## Notation

E - 4/2 on 4+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord I know that life is fragile; That ev'ry breath may be my last. So take my hand from this day forward, As I forsake my shameful past.

### Verse 2

Before Your throne, I kneel in sorrow; My heart the only gift I bring. I place my life upon Your altar; A sacrifice unto my King.

### Verse 3

I bring myself unto the fountain, To join my Savior in the grave. And as I rise a new creation, The old man slips beneath the wave.

### Verse 4

My heart is torn in true repentance; My face awash in tears of shame. But when the Book of Life is open, My joy will be to hear my name.
