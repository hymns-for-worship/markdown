## Notation

D - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! Heir of salvation, purchase of God, Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

### Verse 2

Perfect submission, perfect delight, Visions of rapture now burst on my sight, Angels descending, bring from above, Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

### Verse 3

Perfect submission, all is at rest, I, in my Savior am happy and blest, Watching and waiting, looking above, filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

### Chorus

This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long; This is my story, this is my song; Praising my Savior all the day long.
