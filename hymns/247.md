## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Wounded for me, wounded for me, there on the cross he was wounded for me; gone my transgressions and now I am free, all because Jesus was wounded for me.

### Verse 2

Dying for me, dying for me, there on the cross he was dying for me; now in his death my redemption I see, all because Jesus was dying for me.

### Verse 3

Risen for me, risen for me, up from the grave he was risen for me; now evermore from death's sting I am free, all because Jesus was risen for me.

### Verse 4

Living for me, living for me, up in the skies He is living for me; daily He's pleading and praying for me, all because Jesus is living for me.

### Verse 5

Coming for me, coming for me, one glorious day He is coming for me; then with what joy His dear face I shall see, o, how I praise Him, He's coming for me.
