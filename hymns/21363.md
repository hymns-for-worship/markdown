Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing Thou art scatt'ring full and free, Show'rs the thirsty land refreshing: Let Thy mercy fall on me. Even me, Even me, Let Thy mercy fall on me.

Pass me not, O gracious Savior, Let me live and cling to Thee; I am longing for Thy favor: Whilst Thou'rt calling, O call me. Even me, Even me, Whilst Thou'rt calling, O call me.

Love of God, so pure and changeless, Blood of Christ so rich, so free, Grace of God, so strong and boundless, Magnify them all in me. Even me, Even me, Magnify them all in me.
