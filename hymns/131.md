## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Fade, fade, each earthly joy, Jesus is mine! Break every tender tie, Jesus is mine! Dark is the wilderness, earth has no resting place, Jesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine!

### Verse 2

Tempt not my soul away, Jesus is mine! Here would I ever stay, Jesus is mine! Perishing things of clay, born but for one brief day, pass from my heart away, Jesus is mine!

### Verse 3

Farewell mortality, Jesus is mine! Welcome, eternity, Jesus is mine! Welcome, oh, loved and blest, Welcome sweet scenes of rest, Welcome, my Savior's breast, Jesus is mine!
