## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

No one understands like Jesus, He's a friend beyond compare; Meet Him at the throne of mercy, He is waiting for you there.

### Verse 2

No one understands like Jesus, Ev'ry woe He sees and feels; Tenderly He whispers comfort, And the broken heart He heals.

### Verse 3

No one understands like Jesus, When the foes of life assail; You should never be discouraged, Jesus cares and will not fail.

### Verse 4

No one understands like Jesus, When you falter on the way, Tho you fail Him, sadly fail Him, He will pardon you today.

### Chorus

No one understands like Jesus, When the days are dark and grim; No one is so near, so dear as Je-sus Cast your ev'ry care on Him.
