### Verse 1

Will you share my burden brother? Will you hep me thru my trial? Christ said love and serve each other. Will you walk the second mile?

### Verse 2

Will you soothe my brow, dear sister? Will you hold  my hand thru pain? Does my Lord work thru you, sister? Will He write in heav'n your name?

### Verse 3

I will share your cares, dear brother, as my Lord of love commands. I will ease our heart-break, sister, Give you strength to help you stand.

### Chorus

For the Lord our God is watching, and He's working thru His children. Will you bear another's burden? Will you share the load today?
