### Verse 1

All people that on earth do dwell, sing to the Lord with cheerful voice; Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell, come ye before Him and rejoice.

### Verse 2

Know that the Lord is God indeed; without our aid He did us make; we are His flock, He doth us feed, and for His sheep He doth us take.

### Verse 3

O enter then His gates with joy, within His courts His praise proclaim; let thankful songs your tongues employ, O bless and magnify His name.

### Verse 4

Because the Lord our God is good, His mercy is forever sure; His truth at all times firmly stood, and shall from age to age endure.
