## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Shepherd will supply my need, Jehovah is His Name; In pastures fresh He makes me feed, Beside the living stream. He brings my wand'ring spirit back When I forsake His ways; And leads me, for His mercy's sake, In paths of truth and grace. 

### Verse 2

When I walk thru the shades of death, His presence is my stay; A word of His supporting breath Drives all my fears away. His hand, in sight of all my foes, Doth still my table spread, My cup with blessings overflows, His oil anoints my head.

### Verse 3

The sure provisions of my God attend me all my days; O may His house be my abode, And all my work be praise! There would I find a settled rest, while others go and come; No more a stranger or a guest, But like a child at home.
