# 466 - Does Jesus Care

## Notation

Db - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth or song, As the burdens press, and the cares distress, And the way grows weary and long?

### Verse 2

 Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear? As the daylight fades into deep night shades, Does He care enough to be near?

### Verse 3

 Does Jesus care when I've said "goodby" To the dearest on earth to me, And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks, Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

### Chorus

O yes, He cares, I know He cares, His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares.
