## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In vain in high and holy lays my soul her grateful voice would raise; for who can sing the worthy praise of the wonderful love of Jesus!

### Verse 2

A joy by day, a peace by night, in storms of calm, in darkness light; in pain a balm, in weakness might is the wonderful love of Jesus.

### Verse 3

My hope for pardon when I call, my trust for lifting when I fall; in life, in death, my all in all, is the wonderful love of Jesus.

### Chorus

Wonderful love! Wonderful love! Wonderful love of Jesus! Wonderful love! Wonderful love! Wonderful love of Jesus!
