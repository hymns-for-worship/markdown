# 113 - Where No One Stands Alone

## Notation

Db - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low, in the darkness as black as could be; and my heart felt alone and I cried, "o Lord, don't hide your face from me."

### Verse 2

Like a king I may live in a palace so tall, with great riches to call my own; but I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone.

### Chorus

Hold my hand all the way, every hour, every day, from here to the great unknown. Take my hand; let me stand where no one stands alone.
