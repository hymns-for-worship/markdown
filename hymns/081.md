## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly, while the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high; hide me, o my Savior, hide, till the storm of life is past; safe into the haven guide, o receive my soul at last.

### Verse 2

Other refuge have I none, hangs my helpless soul on Thee; leave, o leave me not alone, still support and comfort me; all my trust on Thee is stayed; all my help from Thee I bring; cover my defenseless head shadow of Thy wing.

### Verse 3

Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin; let the healing streams abound, make and keep me pure within; Thou of life the fountain art; freely let me take of Thee; spring Thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity.
