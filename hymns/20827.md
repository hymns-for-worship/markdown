### Verse 1

Savior, as we eat Your supper, We are joined with those apart. Joined in memory and worship, Near in worthiness of heart.

Holy ones thruout the ages Also joined us as we sup; Saints united, past and future, Sharers in the bread and cup.

All Your church is one in worship, One in heart with You above. Tasting one eternal sharing as we keep the feast of love.
