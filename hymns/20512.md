## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Master, no offering, Costly and sweet, May we, like Magdalene, Lay at Thy feet; Yet may love's incense rise, Sweeter than sacrifice, Dear Lord, to Thee, Dear Lord, to Thee.

### Verse 2

Daily our lives would show Weakness made strong, Toilsome and gloomy ways Brightened with song; Some deeds of kindness done, Some souls by patience won, Dear Lord, to Thee, Dear Lord, to Thee.

### Verse 3

Some word of hope for hearts Burdened with fears, Some balm of peace for eyes Blinded with tears, Some dews of mercy shed, Some wayward footsteps led, Dear Lord, to Thee, Dear Lord, to Thee.

### Verse 4

Thus in Thy service, Lord, Till eventide Closes the day of life, May we abide! And when earth's labors cease, Bid us depart in peace, Dear Lord, to Thee, Dear Lord, to Thee.
