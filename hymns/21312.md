## Notation

Ab - 2/2 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, I turn from my sin, From the battle within; You have brought up my life from the pit. Though my hope seemed to die, Yet You still heard my cry; You revived me when I would have quit. 

### Verse 2

Lord, I long to be pure, Yet my heart is at war, As the Spirit and flesh fight within. By Your grace, help me kill My desire and my will; Set me free from the passion of sin! 

### Verse 3

Though my sin You have known, Now my sin You have thrown Just as far as the east from the west. You remove all my shame. You Yourself know my frame; You are mindful that I am but dust. 

### Chorus

Though the righteous may fall, Mighty God hears their call. To the sea He will cast all their sin! Now all thanks be to God! Though I fall, weak and flawed, O my Lord, help me rise up again!
