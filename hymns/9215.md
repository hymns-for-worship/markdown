## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Love and honor, each man his wife: Dwelling in knowledge, with her for life; Nourish and cherish, as your own soul. Good days will come, more precious than gold.

### Verse 2

Love and rev'rence, each wife her man. Just as the church in Christ's holy plan: Glorious and spotless, one with him true. Good for him always surely you'll do.

### Verse 3

Love and training fathers supply: Never discourage; on them rely. Giving their wisdom: Instruction plain; God's holy word, you truly will gain.

### Chorus

Love and honor, on which we feed, God gives us homes to fill earthly need. With Him as Father, taking the lead, homes will be loving, they will succeed.

### Verse 4

Love and guidance mothers provide, Shelter from storms, in her they abide. "Blessed they'll call," praising her name. Tho' years pass by, she'll e'er be the same. 

### Verse 5

Love and honor children must give. God made a promise, helping you live: listen, obey and trust in their years. It will bring joy and chase away fears.
