## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Far from mortal ills retreating, Sordid hopes and vain desires, Here His saints securely meeting, Ev'ry heart to heav'n aspires. From the fount of glory streaming, Life eternal through us rolls; Mercy from His presence beaming Peace and pardon on our souls. 





### Verse 2

Who may share this great salvation? Ev'ry pure and humble mind, Ev'ry kindred, tongue and nation From the guilt of sin refined. Blessings all around bestowing, God withholds His care from none; Grace and mercy ever flowing From the fountain of His throne.
