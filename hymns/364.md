### Verse 1

The Lord my Shepherd is: I shall be well supplied; Since He is mine, and I am His, What can I want beside? What can I want beside?

### Verse 2

 He leads me to the place Where heav'nly pasture grows, Where living waters gently pass, And full salvation flows, And full salvation flows. 

### Verse 3

 If e'er I go astray, He doth my soul reclaim,  And guides me in His own right way, For His most holy name, For His most holy name.
