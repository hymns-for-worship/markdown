## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God's word tells a story so real and so true. The Lord of creation made me and made you. He gave us a spirit in a vessel of clay, And tells us, "Remember, you will meet Me one day."

### Verse 2

The Potter  has formed us; from dust we were made. He gave us His Spirit to show us the way; He said, "Live your life fully, that is why you were made, Yet always remember you are spirit and clay."

### Verse 3

When the spirit has parted at the end of life's day, God takes up the spirit and leaves only clay. On the day He rewards us, it is then He will say, "Have you lived for the spirit or only the clay?"

### Verse 4

O, how great is the Lord's plan, so pure and divine; He freely gave His love and taught how to give mine. If I live by His gospel, some day He will say, "you have lived for the spirit, come home now to stay."
