## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Our days quickly come and nights swiftly go; We rush thru this life and don't even know That time here on earth is just a passing thing, But there's not time Heaven eternally.

### Verse 2

Our lives here are filled with sadness and fear; We struggle in vain and waste precious years; We long for a time when worries from us flew, But that time is in Heaven eternally.

### Verse 3

Our mem'ries are dear, They keep loved ones near; They've gone on before, We've cried many tears; But it won't be long 'til with them we will be, And that time is in Heaven eternally.

### Chorus

There's no time in Heaven, no days, no weeks, no years; There's no time in Heaven, no sadness or tears; We'll walk in the sunlight and with our Savior be, For there's no time in Heaven eternally.

### Verse 4

The Truth, you will find will bring peace of mind; When walking by faith, we let our light shine; I'm filled with the hope His promise brings to me, For that time is in Heaven eternally.
