## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 9 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ashamed of my Savior? I'll ever decline. With merciful favor, my soul, He refines. Tho' sad my condition and tarnished, my soul; Deserving perdition instead of His fold.

### Verse 2

O Friend, I would serve Thee, Thou light of my day; Let sin not assail me nor darken my way. Tho' often I falter and oft I may stray, Your will is my halter, Your love is my stay.

### Verse 3

So swiftly, life passes; So soon it will end, In dust and in ashes from where life began; But soon 'twill be ending as sure as the dawn, O shall I be wending my way safely home?

### Verse 4

My Lord, will You know me and not be ashamed, To say to the Father, "This one I have claimed"? And will You, my name to Jehovah, confess? O bid me, my Savior, to enter Your rest.
