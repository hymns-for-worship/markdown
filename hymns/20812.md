## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I survey the wondrous cross on which the prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss and pour contempt on all my pride.

### Verse 2

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ, my Lord; All the vain things that charm me most I sacrifice them to His blood.

### Verse 3

See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled down; Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a crown? O the wonderful cross, O the sonderful cross bids me come and die and find that I may truly live. O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross; All who gather here by grace dray near and bless Your name.

### Verse 4

Were the whole realm of nature mine, That were a present far too small; Love so amazing, so divine, Demands my soul, my life, my all O the wonderful cross, O the sonderful cross bids me come and die and find that I may truly live. O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross; All who gather here by grace dray near and bless Your name.
