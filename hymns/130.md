# 130 - Purer Yet And Purer

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Purer yet and purer I would be in mind, dearer yet and dearer, every duty find; hoping still and trusting God without a fear, patiently believing He will make all clear.

### Verse 2

Calmer yet and calmer, trial bear and pain; surer yet and surer, peace at last to gain; suffering still and doing, to His will resigned, and to God subduing heart and will and mind.

### Verse 3

Higher yet and higher, out of clouds and night; nearer yet and nearer, rising to the light; oft these earnest longings, swell within my breast; yet their inner meaning ne'er can be expressed.
