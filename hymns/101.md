## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Savior, as Thou wilt! O may Thy will be mine; into Thy hand of love I would my all resign; thro' sorrow and thro' joy, conduct me as Thine own, and help me still to say, "My Lord, Thy will be done."

### Verse 2

My Savior, as Thou wilt! If needy here and poor, give me Thy people's bread, their portion rich and sure; the manna of Thy word, let my soul feed upon, and, if all else should fail, "my Lord, Thy will be done."

### Verse 3

My Savior, as Thou wilt! Tho' seen thro' many a tear, let not my star of hope grow dim disappear; since Thou on earth hast wept and sorrowed oft alone, if I must weep with Thee, "my Lord, Thy will be done."

### Verse 4

My Savior, as Thou wilt! All shall be well with me; each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee; straight to my homeabove I travel calmly on, and sing, in life or death, "my Lord, Thy will be done."
