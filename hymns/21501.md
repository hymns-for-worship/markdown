## Lyrics

### Verse 2

Thy voice we hear, Thy presence feel, While Thou, too pure for mortal sight, Enwrapt in clouds, invisible, Reignest the Lord of life and light.

### Verse 1

Father and Friend, Thy light, Thy love, Beaming thru all Thy works we see; Thy glory gilds the heav'ns above, And all the earth is full of Thee.

### Verse 3

Thy children shall not faint nor fear, Sustained by this delightful tho't; Since Thou, their God, art ev'rywhere, They cannot be where Thou art not.
