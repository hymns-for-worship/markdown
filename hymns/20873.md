## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I would be true, for there are those who trust me; I would be pure, for there are those who care; I would be strong, for there is much to suffer; I would be brave, for there is much to dare; 

### Verse 2

I would be friend of all the foe, the friendless; I would be giving, and forget the gift; I would be humble, for I know my weakness;I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift;

### Verse 3

I would be pray'rful thru each busy moment; I would be constantly in touch with God; I would be tuned to hear the slightest whisper; I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod
