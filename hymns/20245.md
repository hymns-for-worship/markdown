# 20245 - BE WITH ME

## Notation

D - 2/2 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the foolisness of my heart I make plans for greater things, I run ahead so sure of my own strength, Then when doubt comes rushing in, I crumble then I pray, "Dear Father,  I need  You, please be with me." Be with me when the sun breaks at the dawn.

### Verse 2

Then the Father reaches down and He holds me in His arms, His words so gently spoken fill my soul, He says, "Child, I'm always here, and My work is plain to see. Just open up your eyes and be with Me."

### Chorus

Be with me when the sparrow sings its song. Be with me when the rainbow fills the sky. I've always wanted You to be with me.
