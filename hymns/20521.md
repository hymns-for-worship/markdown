## Notation

D - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish; Come, at the mercy seat  fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, Here tell your anguish; Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot heal.

### Verse 2

Joy of desolate, light of the straying, Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure; Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying, "Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot cure."

### Verse 3

Here see the Bread of Life, see waters flowing Forth from the throne of God, pure from above; Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing Earth has no sorrow that heav'n can't remove.
