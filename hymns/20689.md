## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are going home to rest, By and by when the sun goes down. We shall reach those mansions blest By and by when the sun goes down.

### Verse 2

God will wipe away all tears, Peace and rest, thru endless years By and by when the sun goes down.

### Verse 3

We will never know a sigh, By and by When the Sun goes down. We will never say, "Goodbye." By and by when he sun goes down.

### Verse 4

Blessed hour of all most sweet, By and by when the sun goes down. For our Savior we will meet By and By when the sun goes down.

### Verse 5

We shall join the blood washed throng By and by when the sun goes down. Sing the everlasting song By and by when the sun goes down.

### Chorus

When the sun of our life goes down, We're going home, we're going home; Home to wear a robe and crown, When the sun goes down.
