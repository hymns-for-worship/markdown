## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O safe to the Rock that is higher than I, My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly; So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be; Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee. 

### Verse 2

 In calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour, In times when temptations cast o'er me its pow'r; In tempest of life, on its wide heaving sea, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee. 

### Verse 3

 How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe, I've fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe; How often, when trials like sea billows roll, I've hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul. 

### Chorus

Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.
