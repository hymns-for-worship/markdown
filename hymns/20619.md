## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tear after tear the Lord wept in sorrow While in the garden praying alone. Grieving in anguish He contemplated Death on the cross, my sin to atone.

### Verse 2

Curse after curse was shouted by mockers, Placing a crown of thorns on his head. Tho' He was guiltless, they showed no mercy, Scourging the Lamb of God in my stead.

### Verse 3

Blow after blow, the rough nails were pounded, Tearing His flesh with unyielding pain. Beating in time, the brutal percussion Echoed my guilt in haunting refrain.

### Verse 4

Drop after drop He poured out His lifeblood. Weaker He grew with each passing breath. Mine were the sins for which He was dying. I was the one deserving of death.

### Verse 5

Tear after tear gave way to rejoicing After an angel rolled back the stone. Death could not triumph over the Savior, Nor could the grave deny Him His throne.

### Verse 6

Day after day I strive to be like Him. Step after step I follow His ways. Pray'r after pray'r I raise to His glory. Song after song I sing to His praise.
