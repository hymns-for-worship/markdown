## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When life on earth for me is past, o savior take my hand. Lord, grant that I might firmly stand upon the golden strand.

### Verse 2

When I shall cease to walk life's road, let me come home to thee; take me into thy blest abode to dwell eternally.

### Verse 3

When all my labors are complete and I shall work no more; o savior, guide my weary feet thru death to heaven's door.

### Chorus

For soon my journey here must end, my earthly life must fade. Lord, grant that I might then assen, immortally arrayed.
