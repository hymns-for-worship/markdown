### Verse 1

My voice shall sing to Thee in the morning, O Lord, I wake with thankful praise. My voice shall lift with praise for Thy glory. And in Thy strength I order my day.

### Verse 2

My voice shall sing to Thee in my serving. Each hour I seek to do Thy will. In work, my heart will joy in Thy teaching. In trials, my soul will wait and be still.

### Verse 3

My voice shall sing to Thee in the evening. I gather thoughts in prayer to Thee. Released in trust, content in Thy keeping, My yearning heart secured in Thy peace. 

### Chorus

I shall sing to Thee my sacrifice of praise. I shall sing for loving kindness shown to me. And I shall sing to Thee for Thy goodness, Thy wond'rous pow'r and works of righteousness. And I shall sing for Thy mercy, Thy loving kindness shown to me.
