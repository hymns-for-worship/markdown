## Notation

C - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O heart bowed down with sorrow! O eyes that long for sight! There's gladness in believing; In Jesus there is light. 

### Verse 2

 Divinest consolation Doth Christ the Healer give; Art thou in condemnation? Believe, repent and live.

### Verse 3

 His peace is like a river, His love is like a song; His yoke's a burden never, 'Tis easy all day long. 

### Chorus

Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
