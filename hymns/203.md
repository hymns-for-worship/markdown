## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a beautiful place called heaven, it is hidden above the bright blue, where the good, who from earthties are riven, live and love an eternity thru.

### Verse 2

This land of sweet rest awaits us, some day it will break on our view, 'tis promised by Christ our redeemer, to His followers, faithful and true.

### Verse 3

We know not when he shall call us, whether soon, the glad summons shall be, but we know when we pass o'er the river, the glory of Jesus we'll see.

### Chorus

Above the bright blue, the beautiful blue, Jesus is waiting for me and for you; heaven is there, not far from our sight, beautiful city of light.
