## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here is love, vast as the ocean, Lovingkindness as the flood, When the Prince of life, our ransom, Shed for us His precious blood. Who His love will not remember? Who can cease to sing His praise? He can never be forgotten, Thruout heav'n's eternal days.

### Verse 2

On the mount of crucifixion, Fountains opened deep and wide; Thru the floodgates of God's mercy Flowed a vast and gracious tide. Grace and love, like mighty rivers, Poured incessant from above; Heaven's peace and perfect justice Kissed a guilty world in love.

### Verse 3

You alone shall be my glory; Nothing in the world I see. You have cleansed and sanctified me; You Yourself have set me free. Let me, all Your love accepting, Love You ever all my days; Let me seek Your kingdom only And my life be to Your praise.
