## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye, to Canaan's fair and happy land, where my possessions lie.

### Verse 2

O'er all those wide extended plains, shines one eternal day; there God, the son, forever reigns and scatters night away.

### Verse 3

When shall I reach that happy place, and be forever blest? When shall I see the father's face, and in His bosom rest?

### Chorus

I am bound for the promised land, promised land, I am bound for the promised land; o who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land.
