### Verse 1

Bow Your heavens, O Lord, Come deliver my soul, Touch the mountains that they may smoke, Flash Your light'ning with truth You spoke, Send your arrows and fear invoke, 

### Verse 2

Stretch Your Hand from on high, O deliver my soul, Let Your earth quake with pow’r so vast.  Strike the chains of temptation's grasp. Lift me up where my faith is cast, Rescure me from sin.

O my Lord, strengthen me.
