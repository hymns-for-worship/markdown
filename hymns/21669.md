## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Season your words with all kindness; Stir in compassion and grace; Spice up your comments with patience; Flavor your language with praise. Season your mind with all pureness; Mix with God's sunshine above; Pepper your heart with His goodness; Coat all your moments with love.



### Verse 2

Season your life with thanksgiving; Blend in God's mercy and pow'r; Spread peace and comfort in trials; Sprinkle your journey with awe. Season the world with the gospel; Soak in God's word ev'ry day. Scatter the seeds of the kingdom; Pour out the truth of His way.


### Chorus

You are the salt of the nations; You are the seas'ning divine, Filled with God's grace and compassion, Letting Christ's love always shine.
