## Notation

E - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

High above the seraphim Sounds an everlasting hymn; Voices echo thro' the hall And shake the temple wall. Living creatures bless the King, Four and twenty elders sing, "Worthy, He who overcame;" "The Word of God" His name.

### Verse 2

Praise the  Seed of Abraham! All dominion to the Lamb! Sing of Him, in glory slain, "Lord God Almighty reigns!" Shout the God-breathed prophecy; "He who was will ever be!" "Kings of earth have passed away!" The Son is Lord this day!

### Verse 3

Night to night I come to Him, Kneel before His diadem; While a thousand thousand sing, I fall before the King. Soon will He be changing me, Clothed in immortality, Swallowed up in victory, And evermore to be.
