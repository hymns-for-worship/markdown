O Father, draw me close to You. Calm now my spirit, peace renew. And yes, I know You hear, for You are near, For You have promised, and I believe.

I lift my hand to reach Your face. Find in Your arms a  hiding place, To be enfolded there with I your care, For You have promised and I believe.

I speak Your name into the night. Seek through the pain, Your healing light. And then I will not fear, for You are here, For You have promised, and I believe.
