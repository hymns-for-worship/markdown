## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is rest, sweet rest, at the Master's feet, There is favor now at the mercyseat, For atoning blood has been sprinkled there; There is always a blessing, a blessing in prayer.

### Verse 2

There is grace to help in our time of need, For our Friend above is a Friend indeed, We may cast on Him ev'ry grief and care; There is always a blessing, a blessing in prayer.

### Verse 3

When our songs are glad with the joy of life, When our hearts are sad with its ills and strife, When the pow'rs of sin would the soul ensnare, There is always a blessing, a blessing in prayer.

### Chorus

There's a blessing in prayer, in believing prayer; When our Savior's name to the throne we bear, Then a Father's love will receive us there; There is always a blessing, a blessing in prayer.

### Verse 4

There is perfect peace tho' the wild waves roll; There are gifts of love for the seeking soul, Till we praise the Lord in His home so fair; There is always a blessing, a blessing in prayer.
