### Verse 1

In the calm of Your presence, I am listening Lord; I am still, I am quiet, I am Yours. May Your words speak to me, let Your spirit draw near; I will obey the truth that I hear.

In the calm of Your presence, I am listening Lord; I am still, I am quiet, I am Yours. There's a thirst in my soul for Your wisdom divine. I long for the peace and life that I find. In the calm of Your presence, I am listening Lord; I am still, I am quiet, I am Yours.
