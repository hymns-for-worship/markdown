# 1062 - What Is Love

## Notation

D - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, what is love? A soft fragile thing; It's hard to say words that make your heart sing; A gentle breeze, A soft summer rain, A rose with dew, A walk in the lane.

### Verse 2

A mountain high with clouds in the haze, perhaps sunlight beams across golden blades; A way to live, a way to survive, Because our God is so much alive.

### Verse 3

The love of God is good and so kind; It patiently waits, no evil in mind; Love bears all things; rejoices in truth; Its faith and hope will make the heart sing.

### Chorus

God is love! God is light! God is power! Yes, God is might!
