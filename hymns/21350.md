## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come to the garden, O, come with me; Come there to see what we might see; Jesus, the Lord, was there, you know. There's where He went to pray alone.

### Verse 2

eardrops do stain the garden floor; What, O, dear friend, are these tears for? These are the tears of a threatened Dove, Left in the garden with wondrous love.

### Verse 3

Blooddrops do mar the garden space; Though He was whole, e'er He came this way; This is the blood of a trusting Son, Left in the garden with wondrous love.

### Verse 4

See, now, the tearstains begin to fade; Lo, too, the blooddrops have gone away; Where is the love I cannot see? Gone from the garden to die for me.
