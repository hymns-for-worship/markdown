## Notation

C - 4/4 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Along the road of life I have a friend Divine Who walks with me and gently leads the way; He gives me joy and makes the darkest night to shine; it is my Lord who won my heart one day.

### Verse 2

For many years I did not know His love so true, Until I heard how on the cross He died; I trusted Him, and He became my Savior too, And since that day He’s journeyed by my side.

### Chorus

I do not mind the rough and winding pathway O’er mountains steep, thru valley dark and cold; It is enough to know He travels by my side Along the road that leads to streets of gold!
