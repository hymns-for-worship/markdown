## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The path is dark that I must tread. I cannot see what lies ahead. Thru waters deep, o'er mountains tall, From first to last, God sees it all.

### Verse 2

Without His help, I would not see each stumbling block in front of me. He lights the way lest I should fall. From first to last, God sees it all.

### Verse 3

When pathway's end comes into sight, illuminated with His light. Then I'll rejoice as I recall From first to last, God saw it all.
