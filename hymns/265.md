## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Faith of our fathers! Living still, in spite of dungeon, fire, and sword; o how our hearts beat high with joy whene'er we  hear that glorious word:

### Verse 2

Our Fathers, chained in prisons dark, were still in heart and conscience free; how sweet would be their childrens fate, if they, like them, could die for thee!

### Verse 3

Faith of our Fathers! We love both friend and foe in all our strife; and preach thee, too, as love knows how, by kindly words and virtuous life:

### Chorus

Faith of our Fathers holy faith! We will be true to thee till death!
