## Notation

Gm - 2/2 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He was setting His face toward Jerusalem, for He knew what awaited Him there. With their palm tree branches and shouts of "Hosanna!" they wait for the King to appear.

### Verse 2

He was setting His face toward Jerusalem, for He knew what awaited Him there. Where two limbs form a cross, "Crucify!" cries the mob. Death awaits for the King to appear.

### Verse 3

He was setting His face toward Jerusalem, for He knew what awaited Him there. Tree of Life by the river, "Thou art worthy, O Lord!" Heaven waits for the King to  appear.
