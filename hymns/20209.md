### Verse 1

My Jesus, I have chosen To leave the things I love, That I may know the glory Prepared for me above.

I have no higher calling Than walking where You've trod; On earth I am a stranger, But I am known to God.

### Verse 3

I fix my eyes upon You, Rejoicing in my shame, For He has deemed me worthy To suffer for Your name.
