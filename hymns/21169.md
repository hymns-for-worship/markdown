## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Naught have I gotten but what I received; Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed; Boasting excluded, pride I abase; I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

### Verse 2

Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart, Causing my footsteps from God to depart; Jesus hath found me, happy my case; I now am a sinner saved by grace!

### Verse 3

Tears unavailing, no merit had I; Mercy had saved me, or else I must die; Sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face; But now I'm a sinner saved by grace!

### Verse 4

Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows, Loving his Savior to tell what he knows; Once more to tell it would I embrace I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

### Chorus

Only a sinner saved by grace! Only a sinner saved by grace! This is my story, to God be the glo-ry I'm only a sinner saved by grace!
