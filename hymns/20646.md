### Verse 1

Speak the name of God so solemnly, speak the name of God in pray'r. In a world so full of profanity, speak the name of God with care. El Elon, the God of Israel; El Shaddai, the God of the Mountain. Lord of Hosts, and Righteous Father; we glorify the Great I AM! Holy, holy. Holy, holy, holy is His name.
