## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When I need someone in time of grief, Someone my cheer to be, Jesus I choose, for He gives relief, He is the best for me.

### Verse 2

 When I need someone to guide my soul, Over the stormy sea, Always to Jesus I give control, He is the best for me. 

### Verse 3

 When I need help to defeat the foe, Someone my shield to be, Always to Jesus in faith I go, He is the best for me. 

### Verse 4

When all my trials on earth are o'er, And the dark stream I see, Jesus shall bear me to yonder shore, He is the best for me.

### Chorus

I choose Jesus When I need a friend, What I need I know that He will send; I have proved Him Good and true is He; I choose Jesus, He is the best for me.
