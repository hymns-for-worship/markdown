## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What will you do with Jesus? The question comes to you! And you must give an answer for something you must do.

### Verse 2

What will you do with Jesus? It comes by night and day; with pierced hands uplifted, he waits, what will you say?

### Verse 3

What will you do with Jesus? He's knocking at the door! Refuse him, soul, no longer, lest he should plead no more.

### Chorus

What shall it be, what shall it be? What shall your answer be? What will you do with Jesus? O what shall your answer be?
