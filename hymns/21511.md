## Notation

Eb - 2/4 on 2 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform; He plants His footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm.

### Verse 2

Deep in unfathomable minds Of never failing skill, He treasures up His bright designs, And works His gracious will.

### Verse 3

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take, The clouds ye so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In blessings on your head.

### Verse 4

His purposes will ripen fast, Unfolding ev'ry hour; The bud may have a bitter taste, But sweet will be the flow'r.

### Verse 5

Blind unbelief is sure to err, And scan His work in vain; God is His own interpreter, And He will make it plain.
