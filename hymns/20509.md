## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I wanna be one with You, O God, and walk beside You all the way. Hold my hand in Your hand and be thankful ev'ry day. You're the reason I'm redeemed, rejoicing all the way. I can hardly wait for that eternal glor'ous day!

### Verse 2

I wanna be loved by You, O God, and sing Your praises ev'ry day. Tell the world about You that Christ Jesus is the way. There's no other fountain that can set my spirit free; I can hardly wait, one day His glor'ous face I'll see!

### Verse 3

I wanna go home with You, O God, and see my loved ones 'round the throne; Be with You in heaven and forever be at home. No more night: You'll be our light; we'll live forevermore. I can hardly wait; one day we'll meet o'er on that shore.

### Chorus

I am redeemed, I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed. By Jesus blood I am redeemed. He saved my soul and made me whole. Praise His name I am redeemed.
