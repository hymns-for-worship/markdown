## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One step at a time, dear Savior, I cannot take anymore; The flesh is so weak and hopeless, I know not what is before.

### Verse 2

One step at a time, dear Savior, I am not walking by sight; keep step with my soul, dear Savior, I walk by faith in Thy might.

### Verse 3

One step at a time, dear Savior, Oh, guard my faltering feet! Keep hold of my hand, dear Savior, till I my journey complete.

### Chorus

One step at a time, dear Savior, till faith grows stronger in Thee; one step at a time, dear Savior, till hope grows stronger in me.
