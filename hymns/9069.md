### Verse 1

Glory to God on High! Let heav'n and earth reply; Praise ye His name: His love and grace adore, Who all our sorrows bore And sing forevermore, "Worthy is the Lamb."

### Verse 2

Ye who surround the throne, Join cheerfully in one, Praising His name: Ye who have felt His blood Sealing your peace with God, Sound His dear name abroad; "Worthy is the Lamb"

### Verse 3

Join, all the ransomed race, Our Lord and God to bless; Praise ye His name: In Him we will rejoice, And make a joyful noise Shouting with heart and voice, "Worthy is the Lamb."

### Verse 4

Soon must we change our place; Yet will we never cease Prasing His name; To Him our songs we'll bring, hail Him our gracious King, And through all ages sing, "Worthy is the Lamb."
