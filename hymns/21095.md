## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord in Zion reigneth, Let all the earth rejoice, And come before His throne of grace With tuneful heart and voice; The Lord in Zion reigneth, And there His praise shall ring, To Him shall princes bend the knee, And kings their glory bring.

### Verse 2

The Lord in Zion reign-eth, And who so great as He? The depths of earth are in His hands, He rules the mighty sea; O crown His name with honor, And let His standard wave, Till distant isles beyond the deep Shall own His pow'r to save.


### Verse 3

The Lord in Zion reign-eth, These hours to Him belong, O enter now His temple gates, And fill His courts with song; Beneath His royal banner, Let ev'ry creature fall, Exalt the King of heav'n and earth, "And crown Him Lord of all!"
