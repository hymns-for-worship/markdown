## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You are drifting far from shore, leaning on the idle oar, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down; You are drifting with the tide, to the ocean wild and wide, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down.

### Verse 2

Light upon the Homeland shore give you warning o'er and o'er, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down; Soon beyond the harbor bar will your boat be carried far, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down.

### Verse 3

Voices from the Homeland shore fainter grow, as they implore, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down; O, my brother, do not wait! Heed them ere it be too late, Ere forever you have drifted, drifted down.

### Chorus

You are drifting down, drifting down To the dark and awful sea, You are drifting down from a Father's loving care To the blackness of despair, You are drifting, slowly drifting, drifting down.
