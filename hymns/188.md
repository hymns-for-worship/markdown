# 188 - There Stands A Rock

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There stands a rock on shores of time that rears to heav'n its head sublime; that rock is cleft, and they are blest who find within the cleft of rest.

### Verse 2

That rock's a cross, its arms outspread, cellestial glory bathes its head; to its firm base my all I bring, and to the cross of ages cling.

### Verse 3

That rock's a tow'r whose lofty height, illumed with heav'ns unclouded light, opes wide its gates beneath the dome, where saints find rest with Christ at home.

### Chorus

Some build their hopes on the everdrifting sand, some on their fame or their treasure of their land; mine's on the rock that forever will stand, Jesus the "rock of ages."
