### Verse 1

There is glory just one glory of the sun. There is glory just one glory of the moon; But the glory of all glories is the Son of God, He is glory, He is glory, He is glory.


### Verse 2

There is glory just one glory of the stars. There is glory just one glory in each one; But the glory of all glories is the precious Son; He is glory, He is glory, He is glory. 



### Verse 3

There is glory, just one glory on the earth. There is glory just one glory in it all; But the glory of all glories is the Crucified; He is glory, He is glory, He is glory.
