## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Life's too short to waste in sin, Open your heart, let Jesus in; Your friend, Jesus wants to be; he'll be your Savior, Friend indeed.

### Verse 2

Jesus died upon the cross, He saved us from eternal loss, Paid the ransom on the tree; He died for you, He died for me.

### Verse 3

From your sins now turn away, Live for the Master, start today; Heed His call, don't hesitate; Obey Him now! Why tarry, why wait?

### Chorus

Won't you come and walk with Him? Heaven's gates you'll enter in; Come, let Jesus be your guide; Your soul's need He'll satisfy.
