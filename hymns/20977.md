## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Take the time to pray; Take the time to say Jesus means all the world to me. Take the time to feel; Take the time to kneel In awe before Him who loves you too.

### Verse 2

Take the time to teach; Take the time to reach out to those who are lost in sin. Take the time to care; Take the time to share Good news Jesus is their Royal Friend.

### Verse 3

Take the time to live; Take the time to give of yourself to some soul in need. Take the time to go; Take the time to show God's love as you do a kindly deed.

### Chorus

Don't let this world take your time away from the little things you want to do each day. Love your neighbor as His will you obey, Ev'ry day just take the time.
