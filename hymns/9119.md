## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the quiet of the night when all is still, And darkness veils the beauty of the earth; My soul is restless and my thoughts go soaring, And I wonder, "O, dear God, what am I worth?"

### Verse 2

I'm just dust beneath the soles of Thy feet, Lord, Not worthy to be called a child of Thine; But only by Thy tender grace and mercy, There's a home that's wating for me by and by. 

### Verse 3

Now I pray, that when this world will pass away, And as I stand before Your throne that day, And when You open up the book of life, Lord, I may hear You gently say, "My child, well done."

### Coda

Enter in, thou good and faithful servant, servant Enter in and bow before the throne; Enter in and meet your Lord and Savior, Savior Enter in, for now yo're safe at home.
