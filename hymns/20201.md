## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One of these mornings high up yonder, Gonna be  shouting "praise the Lord." Gonna be a soul that the souls up yonder, Never have seen and never have heard.

### Verse 2

One of these mornings folks that have known me, Souls that have seen me day by day; Gonna be a saying that his Lord has called him, Gonna be a saying he's gone his way. 

### Chorus

One of these mornings high up yonder, Gona be  shouting "praise the Lord." Gonna be a soul that the souls up yonder, Never have seen and never have heard.
