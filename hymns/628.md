## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When I'm lost in darkness, light the way for me, When my soul's in prison, give me liberty, When I stumble, lift me up to stand with Thee; Grant me peace and hope, is my plea.

### Verse 2

 When I sin, Lord, pardon my infirmity, When I've doubted, let me see the prints on Thee, When my load is heavy, lift it up for me; Grant me peace and hope, is my plea.

### Verse 3

 When my body's weakened, give me faith in Thee, When I've lost my dear ones, love and comfort me, When my days have ended, take me home with Thee; Grant me peace and hope is my plea.

### Chorus

I am blind and often lose my way, filled with sadness, terror, and dismay; In our Father's house prepare a place for me. Let me dwell with Thee eternally.
