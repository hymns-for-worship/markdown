# 20409 - BEYOND LIFE'S SUNSET

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a valley, just beyond life's sunset, Where crystal waters of life do flow, 'Mid fragrant flowers and the song of angels, There is a mansion for me I know.

### Verse 2

There is no sorrow, just beyond life's sunset, There is no sickness, no grief or pain, There all is singing, heaven's new song singing, Where joy supernal will ever reign.

### Verse 3

When I must journey, just beyond life's sunset, I want my Savior to hold my hand, For with Him guiding, in His love abiding, the gates will open to Canaan land.

### Chorus

I'll live forever in a land of contentment, while Sharon's Rose blooms in splendor by my jasper door, In God's new Eden, just beyond life's sunset, Toils will be ended forevermore.
