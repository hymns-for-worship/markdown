## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 10 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Troublesome times are here, filling men's hearts with fear, Freedom we all hold dear now is at stake; (is at stake;) Humb'ling your heart to God, saves from the chast'ning rod, Seek the way pilgrims trod, Christians, awake.

### Verse 2

Troubles will soon be o'er, happy forevermore, When we meet on that shore free from all care; Rising up in the sky, telling the world goodby, Homeward we then will fly, glory to share.

### Chorus

Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon, Many will meet their doom, Trumpets will sound, All of the dead shall rise, Righteous meet in the skies, going where no one dies Heaven ward bound.
