## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I long for the home my Lord has prepared, A home up in heav'n above. A beautiful place so wondrously fair; A place filled with God's great love.

### Verse 2

I long for the home where saints praise His name. Forever and evermore. We'll sing 'round His throne, for this is our aim, When life here on earth is o'er.

### Verse 3

I long for the home where loved ones are blest, They're now with the  saved on high. Their spirits enjoy the heavenly rest; Some day we'll meet in the sky.

### Coda

I long for the home with God above, A place where souls never die. Yes, I shall enjoy His wonderful love, Where tears never dim the eye.
