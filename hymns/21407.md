## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I will sing you a song of that beautiful land, The far away home of the soul; Where no storms ever beat on that glittering strand, While the years of eternity roll, While the years of eternity roll; Where no storms ever beat on that glittering strand, While the years of eternity roll.

### Verse 2

O, that home of the soul in my visions and dreams, Its bright jasper walls I can see; Till I fancy but thinly the vale intervenes Between the fair city and me, Between the fair city and me; Till I fancy but thinly the vale intervenes Between the fair city and me.

### Verse 3

That unchangeable home is for you and for me, Where Jesus of Nazareth stands; The King of all kings O some day we shall see, And He holdeth our crowns in His hands; And He holdeth our crowns in His hands; The King of all kings O some day we shall see, And He holdeth our crowns in His hands.
