## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Glorious things of Thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God! He whose word cannot be broken formed thee for His own abode: on the rock of ages founded, what can shake Thy sure repose? With salvation's walls surrounded, Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

### Verse 2

See, the streams of living waters, springing from eternal love, well supply the sons and daughters, and all fear and want remove: who can faint while such a river ever flows their thirst t' assuage? Grace, which like the Lord the giver, never fails from age to age.

### Verse 3

Savior, since of Zion's city I, thro' grace, a member am, let the world deride or pity, I will glory in Thy name. fading is the worldling's pleasure, all his boasted pomp and show; solid joys and lasting treasure none but Zion's children know.
