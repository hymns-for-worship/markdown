## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hear the sweet voice of Jesus say come unto me I am the way; harken the loving call obey; come for he loves me so.

### Verse 2

Casting your heavy burden down; come to the cross, the world is found, yet you shall wear a glorious crown, when he makes up his own.

### Verse 3

Open for you the pearly gate; saved ones for you now watch and wait, terrible thot to cry too late, Jesus I come to thee.

### Chorus

Only a step, only a step; come for he bled for you and died; he's the same loving savior yet, Jesus the crucified.
