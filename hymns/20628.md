## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Place a hedge around me, Lord. Protect me from all harm. I long to dwell in safety underneath Your sheltering arm. Battles raging all around, the noise, a deaf'ning roar, as Satan ever wrestles for my soul, a fierce, relentless war.

### Verse 2

Lead me from the battlefield to quiet pastureland, secured, enclosed, surrounded, comforted with Your loving hand. Place a hedge around me, Lord, a buffer for my soul, as refuge from life's trials on the way to my eternal goal.

### Verse 3

Filled with strength and courage new, Your word my constant guide, I now can face the battle fearlessly with You by my side. There are others in distress: They search to find their way. Please use me, spend me, send me as You will to lead them home today.
