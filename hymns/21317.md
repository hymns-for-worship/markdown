## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"Come to Me" said Jesus, He will give you rest.  Take His yoke upon you, Lean upon His breast.  He is meek and lowly and His burden light.  Come to Him He'll save you, Save you by His might.

### Verse 2

Jesus died to save you; Died for you and me. His great love for sinners; Shownon Calvary. He arose triumphant o'er the grave that day. Now He lives in heaven Let Him be your way. 

### Verse 3

Christ will come from heaven; He will save His own. What a great reunion; And to hear "well done." He will save in heaven those who seek His rest. Come, believe, obey Him; Be forever blest.
