## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tho your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snnow, tho your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Tho they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool; tho your sins be as scarlet, tho your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow, they shall be as white as snow.

### Verse 2

Hear the voice that entreats you, o return ye unto God! Hear the voice that entreats you, o return ye unto God! He is of great compassion, and of wondrous love; hear the voice that entreats you, hear the voice that entreats you, o return ye unto God, O return ye unto God!

### Verse 3

He'll forgive your transgressions and remember them no more, he'll forgive your transgressions and remember them no more; look unto me ye people, saith the Lord your God; He'll forgive your transgressions, he'll forgive your transgressions, and remember them no more, and remember them no more.
