# 222 - After The Shadows

## Notation

Ab - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

After the midnight, morning will greet us; after the sadness joy will appear; after the tempest, sunlight will meet us; after the jeering, praise we shall hear.

### Verse 2

After the battle, peace will be given; after the weeping, song there will be; after the journey there will be heaven, burdens will fall and we shall be free.

### Verse 3

Shadows and sunshine all thru the story, teardrops and pleasure, day after day; but when we reach the kingdom of glory, trials of earth will vanish away.

### Chorus

After the shadows, there will be sunshine; after the frown, the soulcheering smile; cling to the savior, love Him forever; all will be well in a little while.
