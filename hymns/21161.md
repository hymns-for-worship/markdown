## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O bless the Lord, my soul! Let all within me join, And aid my tongue to bless His name Whose favors are divine. O bless the Lord, my soul! Nor let His mercies lie Forgotten in unthankful ness, And without praises die.

### Verse 2

The Lord forgives your sins; And He relieves your pain; And He heals all your sicknesses, And gives you strength again. He crowns your life with love, When rescued from the grave; He that redeemed our souls from death, Has boundless pow'r to save.

### Verse 3

He fills the poor with good; He gives the suff'rers rest: The Lord has justice for the proud, And mercy for th'oppressed. His wondrous works and ways He made by Moses known; But sent the world His truth and grace By His beloved Son.

### Coda

Amen.
