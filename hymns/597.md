## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O for a closer walk with God, A calm and heav'nly frame, A light to shine upon the road That leads me to the Lamb.

### Verse 2

 Where is the blessedness I knew When first I saw the Lord? Where is the soulrefreshing view Of Jesus and His word?

### Verse 3

 The dearest idol I have known, Whate'er that idol be, Help me to tear it from Thy throne, And worship only Thee.

### Verse 4

 So shall my walk be close with God, Calm and serene my frame; So purer light shall mark the road That leads me to the Lamb.
