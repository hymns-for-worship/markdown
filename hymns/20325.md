## Notation

E - 4/4 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He washed my eyes with tears that I might see, The broken heart I had was good for me; He tore it all apart and looked inside, He found it full of fear and foolish pride. He swept away the things that made me blind, And then I saw the clouds were silver lined; And now I understand 'twas best for me,

### Verse 2

He washed my eyes with tears that I might see, The glory of Himself revealed to me; I did not know that He had wounded hands, I saw the blood He shed upon the sands.I saw the marks of shame and wept and cried, He was my substitute for me He died; And now I'm glad He came so tenderly  And washed my eyes with tears that I might see.
