## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Â Jesus, my Savior, to Bethlehem came, Laid in a manger to sorrow and shame; O it was wonderful, blest be His name, Seeking for me, for me: Seeking for me, Seeking for me, Seeking for me, Seeking for me: O it was wonderful, blest be His name, Seeking for me, for me.

### Verse 2

Jesus, my Savior, in mercy and love, Came from the mansions of heaven above, Tenderly pleading for sinners like me, Pleading for me, for me: Pleading for me, Pleading for me, Pleading for me, Pleading for me: Tenderly pleading for sinners like me, Pleading for me, for me.

### Verse 3

Jesus, my Savior, the same as of old, While I did wander afar from the fold, Gently and long He hath pled with my soul, Calling for me, for me: Calling for me, Calling for me, Calling for me, Calling for me: Gently and long He hath pled with my soul. Calling for me, for me.

### Verse 4

Jesus, my Savior, shall come from on high, Sweet is the promise as weary years fly; O I shall see Him descending the sky, Coming for me, for me: Coming for me, Coming for me, Coming for me, Coming for me, O I shall see Him descending the sky, Coming for me, for me.
