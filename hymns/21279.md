## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I behold Thy glory share, The stars unfurled, the splendored sky; All nature bows, creation shouts, Then I believe that God is real.

### Verse 2

I see His face in ev'ry storm, A fleeting glance on wings of morn; His wonders ever to perform, For I believe Yes, I believe that God is real.

### Verse 3

The little drops of dew that fall, The birds that sing, God's creatures call; From ocean wide, He's by my side, And I believe Yes, I believe that God is real.

### Verse 4

The morning sun night's shade enfolds, A million tongues could not recall; His mighty pow'r but speak Thy Word, And I believe , I believe that God is real.

### Chorus

Yes, I believe that God loves me. His hand I feel, His ways I see, From moving tides, 'Cross space so wide, For I believe that God is real. Yes, I believe that God loves me. His hand I feel, His ways I see, From moving tides 'Cross space so wide, For I believe that God is real.
