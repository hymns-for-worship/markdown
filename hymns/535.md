## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Savior, mine, I remember Thee Suff'ring on that cruel tree; Now I seek to do Thy will And in love Thy word fulfill. 

### Verse 2

 Glorious Savior, Lamb of God, On this earth Thy feet once trod; God as man— perfect sacrifice; On the cross You paid sin's price. 

### Verse 3

 Blood and water flowing down, Granting me a priceless crown; Hands and feet were nailed by me; From my guilt You set me free!

### Verse 4

 Savior, mine, remember me As I serve and follow Thee; Dead to self, my cross I bear; Life indeed! with Thee I share.
