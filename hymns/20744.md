### Verse 1

When the night is falling, and the day is done, I can hear You calling,"Come!" I will come while You sing over me. How I love you, Child! I love you! How I love you, child! I love you! How I love you! How I love you! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! When this life is over, and the race is run, I will hear You calling, "Come!" I will come while You sing over me.

### Verse 2

When the night surrounds me, all my dreams undone, I can hear You calling, "Come!" I will come while You sing over me. When the night would hide my way I will listen until I hear You say,

### Verse 3

When this life is over, and the race is run, I will hear You calling, "Come!" I will come while You sing over me.
