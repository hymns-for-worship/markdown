## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Why did the Savior heaven leave And come to earth below Where men His grace would not receive? Because He loves me so! 

### Verse 2

 Why did the Savior mark the way, And why temptation know? Why teach and toil and plead and pray? Because He loves me so!

### Verse 3

 Why feel the garden's dreadful dross? Why thru His trials go? Why suffer death upon the cross? Because He loves me so! 

### Chorus

He loves me! He loves me! He loves me this I know! He gave Himself to die for me, Because He loves me so!
