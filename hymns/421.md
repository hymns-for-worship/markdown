## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Christ will me His aid afford, Whene'er I call, whene'er I call; While I find my precious Lord Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

### Verse 2

 I can follow all the way, Hearing Him call, hearing Him call; Finding Him from day to day,


### Verse 3

When I reach the crystal sea, Voices will call, voices will call; But my Savior's voice will be

Jesus is now and ever will be, Sweeter than all the world to me, Since I heard His loving call, Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.
