## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As I travel on the highway going thru this present life, I am happy as I journey on the way. For my Savior is beside me thru all pain and thru all strife, but I'm looking for that brighter day.

### Verse 2

O the way that is called blessed, it is narrow, it is strait, but it leads at last to heaven as the goal. Tho' the pathway may be rugged I will not have long to wait, soon I'll reach the blessed home of the soul.

### Verse 3

Won't you come and journey with me, O what fellowship so sweet, As we help each other all along the way. Lifting up the hanging hands and making strong the feeble feet, we'll be looking for that brighter day.

### Chorus

I am traveling along Going to place of song. trav'ling on, trav'ling on. Go-ing to that place of song. Thru eternity I'll sing with the blessing of my heav'nly King.
