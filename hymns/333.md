### Verse 1

Will you come, will you come? With your poor broken heart, burdened and sin oppressed? Lay it down at the feet of your savior and lord, Jesus will give you rest.

Will you come, will you come? There is mercy for you, balm for your aching breast; obey Jesus your lord, heed his every command, Jesus will give you rest.

Will you come, will you come? How he pleads with you now; fly to his loving breast; and whatever your sin or your sorrow may be, Jesus will give you rest.
