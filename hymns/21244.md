## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling, To tell to all the world that God is Light; That He who made all nations is not willing One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

### Verse 2

Behold how many thousands still are lying Bound in the darksome prisonhouse of sin, With none to tell them of the Savior's dying, Or of the life He died for them to win.

### Verse 3

Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious; Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way; Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious; And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.

### Verse 4

He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him, Make known to ev'ry heart His saving grace; Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him, Thru thy neglect, unfit to see His face.

### Chorus

Publish glad tidings, Tidings of peace; Tidings of Jesus, Redemption and release.
