## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When Jesus left His Father's throne, He chose a humble birth; Like us, unhonored and unknown, He came to dwell on earth. Like Him may we be found below, In wisdom's path of peace; Like Him in grace and knowledge grow, As years and strength increase.

### Verse 2

Sweet were His words and kind His look, When mothers round Him pressed; Their infants in His arms He took, And on His bossom blessed. Safe from the world's alluring harms, Beneath His watchful eye, Thus in the circle of His arms May we forever lie.

### Verse 3

When Jesus into Zion rode, The children sang around; For joy they plucked the palms and strewed Their garments on the ground. Hosanna our glad voices raise, Hosanna to our King! Should we forget our Savior's praise, The stones themselves would sing.
