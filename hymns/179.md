## Lyrics

### Verse 1

King of my life I crown we now, thine shall the glory be, lest I forget thy thorncrowned brow, lead me to calvary.

### Verse 2

Show me thetomb where thou was laid, tenderly mourned and wept; angels in robes of light arrayed guarded us whilst thou slept.

### Verse 3

Let me like Mary, thru the gloom come with a gift to thee; show to me now the empty tomb, lead me to calvary.

May I be willing, Lord to bear daily my cross for Thee; even the cup of grief to share, Thou hast born all for me.

Lest I forget gethsemane, lest I forget thine agony, lest I forget thy love for me, lead me to calvary.
