## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Restore my spirit, Lord, I need restored; My heart is weary, please help me, dear Lord. I stand in need of more strength from Your Word. Renew my love, rebuild my faith, O, restore my soul.

### Verse 2

Revive the fire, Lord, deep in my soul; Stir my desire to work in Your fold. Light in my heart, dear God, Your zeal grown cold. Renew my love, rebuild my faith, O, restore my soul.

### Verse 3

Renew my courage, Lord, it needs restored;  My cup is empty, refill it, dear Lord.  Replace all doubts and fear with faith so bold. Renew my love, rebuild my faith, O, restore my soul.
