# 162 - Night, With Ebon Pinion

## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Night with ebon pinion, brooded o'er the vale; all around was silent, save the night winds wail, when Christ, the man of sorrows, in tears and sweat as blood, prostrate in the garden, raised His voice to God.

### Verse 2

Smitten for offenses which were not His own, He for our transgresses had to weep alone; no friend with words to comfort, nor hand to help was there; when the meek and lowly humbly bowed in prayer.

### Verse 3

Abba, Father, Father, if indeed it may, let this cup of anguish pass from me I pray; yet if it must be suffered by me thine only son, Abba, Father, Father, let thy will be done.
