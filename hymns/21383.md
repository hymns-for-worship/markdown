## Lyrics

### Coda

Amen.

### Verse 1

Glory be to Jesus, who, in bitter pains, Poured for me the lifeblood from His sacred veins!

### Verse 2

Grace and life eternal in that blood I find; Blest be His compassion infinitely kind!

### Verse 3

Blest thru endless ages be the precious stream Which from endless torments did the world redeem!

### Verse 4

Abel's blood for vengeance pleaded to the skies; But the blood of Jesus for our pardon cries.

### Verse 5

Oft as earth exulting wafts its praise on high, Angel hosts rejoicing make their glad reply.

### Verse 6

Lift we, then, our voices, swell the mighty flood, Louder still and louder praise the precious blood!
