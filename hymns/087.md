## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be still my sou; the Lord is on thy side… Bear patiently the cross of grief and pain; leave to thy God to order and provide… In every change He faithful will remain. Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly friend… thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

### Verse 2

Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake… to guide the future as He has the past. Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;… all now mysterious shall be bright at last. Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know… His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

### Verse 3

Be still, my soul. The hour is hastening on… when we shall be forever with the Lord; when disappointment, grief and fear are gone;… sorrow forget, love's purest joys restored. Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,… all safe and blessed o we shall meet at last.
