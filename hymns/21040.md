## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I was once a sinner, but I came Pardon to receive from my Lord, This was freely given, and I found That He always kept His word.

### Verse 2

In the book 'tis written, "Saved by grace;" O the joy that came to my soul! Now I am forgiven, and I know, By the blood I am made whole.

### Chorus

There's a new name written down in glory, And it's mine, O yes, it's mine! And the whiterobed angels sing the story, "A sinner has come home;" For there's a new name written down in glory, And it's mine, O yes, it's mine! With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven, Nevermore to roam.
