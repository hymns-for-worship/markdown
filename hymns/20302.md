## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are clouds that come in springtime Bringing showers fresh and clean; Making flowers show their beauty, Making ev'ry meadow green. There are stormclouds dark and angry, Often making man afraid; Other clouds seem but to tell me, "Rest you here within my shade." 

### Verse 2

There are clouds that reach the heavens, Far away out in the west; Standing high in flaming slendor While the sun lies down to rest. Clouds aglow so oft have shown me Golden paths that span the sea; Are they like the path that leads me When my Savior calls for me?

### Verse 3

No, but there's a cloud up yonder, Cloud like none that man has known, One to bear my Savior downward When He comes to take me home; Then I'll bend my knee with others, And my soul will surely cry,  "Cloud of Gladness, Awesome Shadow!" Shade me some day by and by.
