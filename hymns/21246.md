Some trust in chariots Some trust in horses; We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God.

Some trust in the work they do but by His grace all the work is thru; We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. His love never fails, His Name will always prevail. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God.

Some trust in the wealth of things the Name worth more than anything; We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God. His love never fails, His Name will always prevail. We trust in the Name of the Lord, our God.
