## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder consider all the worlds Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.

### Verse 2

When thru the woods and forest glades I wander and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees; when I look dowon from lofty mountain grandeur and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

### Verse 3

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in: that on the cross, my burdens gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.

### Verse 4

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

### Chorus

Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
