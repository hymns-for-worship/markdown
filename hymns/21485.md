## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Why stand ye idle all day long? Jesus invites you thru this song. Labor for Him, His wages are good, You can work for Him if you would.

### Verse 2

Why stand ye idle all day long? Working for Christ you can't go wrong, More in this life He's promised to give, Then in Heaven we'll ever live.

### Verse 3

Harvest is here, the workers few, Why stand idle? There's much to do! For the Master labor while you may, What if the last hour were today?

### Chorus

Why stand ye idle all day long? Your labor Jesus will repay, Work in His vineyard, be loyal and true, A palace then He'll give unto you.
