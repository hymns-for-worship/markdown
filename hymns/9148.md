## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have met to eat your supper, Lord, And I truly count the cost. O help me discern Your body now, As You died on Calvary's cross.

### Verse 2

Let me see Your outstetched nailscarred hands, And the thorns that mde your crown. And the Roman sword that pierced Your side, Then Your life's blood flowed freely down.

### Verse 3

Let me see that borrowed empty tomb. Risen Savior! King of Kings! As I eat believing in Your word, My true worship now do I bring.

### Verse 4

I believe that You will come again, And the saved ones You will reap. I will claim my final cleansing then, I will worship at Your dear feet.
