## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In loving kindness Jesus came My soul in mercy to reclaim, And from the depths of sin and shame Thru grace He lifted me. (He lifted me.)

### Verse 2

 He called me long before I heard, Before my sinful heart was stirred, But when I took Him at His word, Forgiv'n He lifted me. (He lifted me.)

### Verse 3

 His brow was pierced with many a thorn, His hands by cruel nails were torn, When from my guilt and grief, forlorn, In love He lifted me. (He lifted me.)

### Verse 4

 Now on a higher plane I dwell, And with my soul I know 'tis well, Yet how or why, I cannot tell, He should have lifted me. (He lifted me.)

### Chorus

From sinking sand He lifted me, With tender hand He lifted me, From shades of night to plains of llight, O praise His name, He lifted me!
