## Lyrics

### Chorus

As He hung on the tree, Our Savior died for you and me. Come to him now, He will make you now.

### Verse 1

While on my vessel lost at sea, I was drifting aimlessly; The waves were rough and tossing me No one heard my plea, And void of bearings hopeless me; Someone pointed to a tree; Come to Him now, He will set you free.

### Verse 2

My friend, if you are lost in sin, Let me tell you about Him. Christ came to earth prepared to die, He was crucified. He gives me life eternally, By His death upon the tree; Come to Him now, He will set you free.
