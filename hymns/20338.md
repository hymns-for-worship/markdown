## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Somebody did a golden deed, Proving himself a friend in need; Somebody sang a cheerful song, Bright'ning the sky the whole day long, Was that somebody you?  Was that somebody you?

### Verse 2

Somebody tho't 'tis sweet to live, Willingly said, "I'm glad to give;" Somebody fought a valiant fight, Bravely he lives to shield the right, Was that somebody you?  Was that somebody you?

### Verse 3

Somebody made a loving gift, Cheerfully tried a load to lift; Somebody told the love of Christ, Told how His will was sacrificed, Was that somebody you?  Was that somebody you?

### Verse 4

Somebody filled the days with light, Constantly chased away the night; Somebody's work bore joy and peace, Surely his life shall never cease, Was that somebody you?  Was that somebody you?
