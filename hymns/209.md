# 209 - Christ For The World We Sing

## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ for the world! We sing; the world to Christ we bring, with loving zeal; the poor and them that mourn, the faint and overborne, sinsick and sorrowworn, whom Christ doth heal.

### Verse 2

Christ for the world! We sing, the world to Christ we bring, with fervant prayer; the wayward and the lost, by restless passion tossed, redeemed at countless cost from dark despair.

### Verse 3

Christ for the world! We sing, the world to Christ we bring, with one accord; with us the work to share, with us reproach to dare, with us the cross to bear,for Christ our Lord.
