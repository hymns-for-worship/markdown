## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Bring christ your broken life, so marred by sin, he will create anew, make whole again, your empty wasted years, he will restore and your iniquity, remember no more.

### Verse 2

Bring him your every care, if great or small, whatever troubles you, o bring it all, bring him the haunting fears, the nameless dread, thy heart he will relieve, and lift up thy head.

### Verse 3

Blest savior of us all, almighty friend! His presence shall be ours unto the end; without him life would be how dark how drear! But with him morning breaks and heaven is near!
