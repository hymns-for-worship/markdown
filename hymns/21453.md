## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Following stormclouds, cometh the sunlight, Following heartaches, cometh sweet peace; So in our lives ofttimes when in trouble, Jesus is waiting to give us release. 

### Verse 2

Brooding o'er sorrow stealeth our comfort, All will be well, for God's way is best, Chastened and humble we see His glory, Portrayed by whom was given the test.

### Verse 3

Following earth life cometh the crowning, Into God's Kingdom, af-ter awhile; Seeing the sunlight gleaming forever, Shine from our Savior's welcoming smile. 

### Chorus

Heartaches will come, and, yet there's a blessing, After each heartache, if we but knew, Christ is behind the darkest of stormclouds, Sunlight will come if to Him we're true.
