## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Within the heart of ev'ry man He strives himself to understand; God's mighty hand from ages past, Declare His work of righteousness.

### Verse 2

From greatest man to infant child, From space afar to grain of sand; 'Tis written plain, it's ev'rywhere, That God is real His wondrous pow'r.

### Verse 3

I see his pow'r, ten thousand worlds, the order of the universe; Where'ere man goes, God's gone before, Foundations laid, creation morn.

### Chorus

I hear His voice, ten thousand tongues, The rocks and hills the birds that sing; The rippling brook, all nature tells, That God still lives and all is well.

### Verse 4

Tho' man may go to distant star God's hand laid out, the parth afar, and lo, returns to earth again, Man can but say, "How great Thou art."
