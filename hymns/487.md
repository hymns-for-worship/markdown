Ab - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Buried with Christ, my blessed Redeemer, Dead to the old life of folly and sin; Satan may call, the world may entreat me, There is no voice that answers within.


### Verse 2

 Dead unto sin, alive thru the Spirit, Risen with Him from the gloom of the grave, All things are new, and I am rejoicing, In His great love, His power to save.


### Verse 3

 Sin hath no more its cruel dominion, Walking "in newness of life," I am free Glorious life of Christ, my Redeemer, Which He so richly shareth with me.

### Chorus

Dead to the world, to voices that call me, Living anew, obedient but free; Dead to the joys that once did enthrall me, Yet 'tis not I, Christ liveth in me.
