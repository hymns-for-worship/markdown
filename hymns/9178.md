## Notation

F - 3/4 on 2+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Stop for a moment and take  heed how you are living. Are you lost and trav'ling down life's road of sin? Don't you know when it comes time for your departure, Then you'll know that this is where your jouney ends.

### Verse 2

Don't be deceived by this world's lust and all its riches. If you could gain the whole wide world it could not bring Peace of God that passes all our understanding, Or a home in heav'n where Jesus Christ does reign.

### Verse 3

Oh yes, how diff'rent if you've lived your life for Jesus. Life's course is finished and you made it all worth while. You can say I've kept the faith and now I'm ready. I fought the fight and I'll depart here with a smile.

### Chorus

I don't know about you but I want heaven To be my home and live with Jesus whom I trust.
