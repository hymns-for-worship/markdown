## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Precious forever! O, wonderful words, teach me the pathway of duty; lead me beside the still waters of life, flowing thru valleys of beauty.

### Verse 2

Freely he offers their promise to all, "come unto me whosoever;" sinners oppressed with a burden of woe, drink of the bountiful river.

### Verse 3

Wouldst thou refuse the sweet solace he gives in the midst of the sorrow? Wouldst thou go on in the darkness of sin, longing for no bright tomorrow?

### Chorus

Precious forever to you and to me, words that our savior has spoken, bearing salvation far over the sea, healing the hearts that are broken!
