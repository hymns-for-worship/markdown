## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sometimes pain is hard to bear, Pain so strong that loved ones feel it. Tho' they sorrow, tho' they care, Only God can heal it.

### Verse 2

When my prayer is hardly heard, Weak with rambling and repeating, God leans in to hear each word, And to feel my pleading.

### Verse 3

Prayer by prayer, O, I am blessed: God restores the joy of living! Each petition, each request Brings a new thanksgiving.

### Chorus

God is there! God is There! Hour by hour! Ev'rywhere! I believe! O, I believe! I believe in prayer.
