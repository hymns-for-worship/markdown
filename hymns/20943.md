## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Led like a Lamb, a lamb to the slaughter, You spoke not a word, but chose to be silent, tho' You did no wrong, nor was deceitfulness found in You. You were despised, You were rejected, Lord. Those who passed by even averted their gaze from the sight: Such was the suff'ring You bore for us.

### Verse 2

Yet by Your wounds our salvation has come. Yet by Your suff'ring our freedom is won.  For God has highly exalted Your name. He has enthroned You on high, Jesus the name above all names. God has highly exalted Your name. He has enthroned You on high, Jesus the name above all names.

### Verse 3

You were despised, You were rejected, Lord. Those who passed by even averted their gaze from the sight: Such was the suff'ring You bore for us.
