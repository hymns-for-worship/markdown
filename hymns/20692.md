Eb - 6/8 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a holy and beautiful city, Whose builder and ruler is God; John saw it descending from heaven, When Patmos, in exile, he trod; Its high, massive wall is of jasper, The city itself is pure gold; And when  my frail tent here is folded Mine eyes shall its glory behold.

### Verse 2

No sin is allowed in that city, And nothing defiling nor mean; No pain and no sickness can enter, no crepe on the doorknob is seen; Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten, No tempter is there to annoy; No parting words ever are spoken, There's nothing to hurt and destroy.

### Verse 3

No heartaches are known in that city, No tears ever moisten the eye; There's no disappointment in heaven, No envy and strife in the sky; The saints are all sanctified wholly, They live in sweet harmony there; My heart is now set on that city, And some day its blessing I'll share.

### Chorus

In that bright city, pearly white city, I have a mansion, a robe, and a crown, Now I am watching, waiting and longing, For the white city John saw coming down.
