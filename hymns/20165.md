### Verse 1

When I call my God, He hears me; When I seek Him He is there. When I need His truth to help me see, His light radiates ev'ry where.

### Verse 2

When I need His care, He helps me, Through each trial, great or small; When I need His strength to carry me, His arms lift me up lest I fall.

When I need His peace, He heals me, In compassion, tender love. When I need His mercy and His grace, It flows through the blood of His Son.
