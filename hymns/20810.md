## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sitting at the feet of Jesus, Waching, waiting ev'ry day; trusting in His grace and power, Save to keep me all the way.

### Verse 2

List'ning at the feet of Jesus, His command to go or stay; Trusting always in His wisdom, Safe to guide when I obey.

### Verse 3

Seeking still the feet of Jesus, I would seek no other place; For 'tis there I claim the promise of the fullness of His Grace.Â 

### Verse 4

When the toils of life are over, when my race on earth is run; May the eve'ning shadows gath'ring Find me there when day is done.

### Chorus

Sitting at the feet of Jesus, Where I love to kneel and pray, Till His goodness and His Glory, Drive the shadows from my way.
