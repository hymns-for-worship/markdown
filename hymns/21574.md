## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, By His presence all divine? True and tender, pure and precious, O how blest to call Him mine!

### Verse 2

Love of Christ so freely given, Grace of God beyond degree, Mercy higher than the heaven, Deeper than the deepest sea.

### Verse 3

What a wonderful redemption! Never can a mortal know How my sin, tho' red like crimson, Can be whiter than the snow.

### Verse 4

By the crystalflowing river With the ransomed I will sing, And forever and forever Praise and glorify the King.


### Chorus

All that thrills my soul is Jesus; He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand, In my blessed Lord I see.
