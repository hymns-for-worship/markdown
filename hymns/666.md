## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 My precious Savior suffered pain and agony, He bore it all that I might live; He broke the bonds of sin and set the captive free, He bore it all that I might live.  

### Verse 2

 They placed a crown of thorns upon my Savior's head, He bore it all that I might live;  By cruel man with spear His side was pierced  and bled, He bore it all that I might live.

### Verse 3

 Up Calv'ry's hill in shame the blessed Savior trod, He bore it all that I might live; Between two thieves they crucified the Son of God, He bore it all that I might live. 

### Chorus

He bore it all that I might see His shining face, He bore it all that I might live; I stood condemned to die but Jesus took my place; He bore it all that I might live.
