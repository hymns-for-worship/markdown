## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Since you have been saved in Christ Jesus, Let love be on things up above, Our Savior is reigning in heaven, Assuring us of His great love. Adorn now the Christian's apparel, Forbearance, forgiveness and love; Have mercy and kindness, humility. As Christ forgave us, so do ye.

### Verse 2

Let words of Christ dwell in you richly, With wisdom to teach those in sin. Sing psalms, hymns and songs of the Spirit; Admonish each other again. With grace in your heart sing God's praises. Do all in the name of the Lord. In word or in deed give Him glory, He'll bless you eternally.
