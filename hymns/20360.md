# 20360 - ON THE JERICHO ROAD

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3a - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As you travel along on the Jericho road Does the world seem all wrong and heavy your load? Just bring it to Christ, your sins all confess,

### Verse 2

O brother to you this message I bring, Tho' hope may be gone, He'll cause you to sing; At Jesus command, sin's shackles must fall, On the Jericho road will you answer His call?

### Chorus

On the Jericho road your your heart He will bless On  the Jericho road there's room for just two, no more and no less, Just Jesus and you; Each burden He'll bear, each sorrow He'll share, there's never a care for Jesus is there.
