### Verse 1

God of our fathers, whose almighty hand leads forth in beauty all the starry band of shining worlds in splendor thro' the skies, our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.

Thy love divine hath led us in the past; in this free land by Thee our lot is cast; be Thou our ruler, guardian, guide and stay, Thy word our law, Thy path our chosen way.

From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence, be thy strong arm our ever sure defense; thy true religion in our hearts increase, thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
