# 21075 - MY PRECIOUS BIBLE

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a Star of the morning in its beauty, Like a Sun is the Bible to my soul, Shining clear on the way of love and duty, As I hasten on my journey to the goal.

### Verse 2

Tis a Light in the wilderness of sorrow, And a Lamp on the weary pilgrim way, And it guides to the bright, eternal morrow, Shining more and more unto the perfect day.

### Verse 3

Tis the Voice of a Friend forever near me, In the toil and the battle here below; In the gloom of the valley it will cheer me, Till the glory of His kingdom I shall know.

### Verse 4

It shall stand in its beauty and its glory, When the earth and the heavens pass away; Ever telling the blessed, wondrous story Of the loving Lamb, the only Living Way.

### Chorus

Holy Bible! My precious Bible! Gift of God, and Lamp of life, My Beautiful Bible! I will cling to the dear, old Holy Bible, As I hasten to the City of the King. Book Divine! Bible! Thou art mine!
