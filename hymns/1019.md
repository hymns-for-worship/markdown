## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, Lord, prepare me, to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true; With thanksgiving I'll be a living sanctuary for You. Lord, teach Your children to stop the fighting, start uniting all as one; Let's get together, loving forever, sanctuary for You.

### Verse 2

You were the One, Lord, who sent the Savior, heart and soul, Lord, for our land; It is You, Lord, who knows our weakness; You refine us with Your hand. O, Lord, prepare me, to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true; With thanksgiving I'll be a living sanctuary for You.
