## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ, by heav'nly hosts adored, Gracious, mighty, sov'reign Lord, God of nations, King of kings, Head of all created things, By the church with joy confessed, God o'er all, forever blessed Pleading at Thy throne we stand: Save Thy people, bless our land.

### Verse 2

On our fields of grass and grain, Send, O Lord, the kindly rain; O'er our wide and goodly land, Crown the labors of each hand. Let Thy kind protection be O'er our commerce on the sea. Open, Lord, Thy bounteous hand; Bless Thy people, bless our land.

### Verse 3

Let our rulers ever be Men that love and honor Thee; Let the pow'rs by Thee ordained Be in righteousness maintained. In the people's hearts increase Love of piety and peace. Thus united, may we stand One wide, free, and happy land.
