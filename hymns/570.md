## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As the life of a flow'r, As a breath or a sigh, So the years that we live As a dream hasten by; True, today we are here, But tomorrow may see Just a grave in the vale, And a mem'ry of me.

### Verse 2

 As the life of a flow'r,  Be our lives pure and sweet; May we brighten the way  For the friends that we greet; And sweet incense arise, From our hearts as we live Close to Him who doth teach Us to love and forgive.

### Verse 3

 While we tarry below Let us trust and adore Him who leads us each day Tow'rd the radiant shore Where the sun never sets, And the flow'rs never fade, Where no sorrow or death May its borders invade.

### Chorus

As the life of a flow'r, As a breath or a sigh, So the years glide away, And alas we must die.
