## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have mercy on me, O God, Against You alone I have sinned; My spirit was lost in sinfulness, Have mercy on me, O God.

### Verse 2

Have mercy on me, O God, My sin is always before me; Please wash me from my iniquities, Have mercy on me, O God. O Lord, blot out my transgressions, And wash me white as snow; Cast me not from Your presence That Your fellowship I may know. Have mercy on me, O God, O cleanse me from my sins; Have mercy on me, O God, O my Lord, Have mercy on me, O God.

### Verse 3

Have mercy on me, O God, A sacrifice I bring, My broken and contrite heart offfering, Have mercy on me, O God.

### Verse 4

Have mercy on me, O God, Please grant me joy and gladness, Removing the guilt of sin away, Have mercy on me, O God. O Lord, blot out my transgressions, And wash me white as snow; Cast me not from Your presence That Your fellowship I may know. Have mercy on me, O God, O cleanse me from my sins; Have mercy on me, O God, O my Lord, Have mercy on me, O God.
