# 390 - Anywhere With Jesus

## Notation

D - 6/8 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, Anywhere He leads me in this world below; Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade; Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

### Verse 2

 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone; Other friends may fail me, He is still my own; Tho' His hand may lead me over drearest ways, Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

### Verse 3

 Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea, Telling souls in darkness of salvation free; Ready as He summons me to go or stay, Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way. 

### Chorus

Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know; Anywhere wih Jesus I can safely go.
