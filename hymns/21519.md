# 21519 - HERE, O MY LORD, I SEE THEE

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face; Here would I touch and handle things unseen; Here grasp with firmer hand the eternal grace, And all my weariness upon Thee lean.


### Verse 2

Here would I feed upon the bread of God; Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n; Here would I lay aside each earthly load, Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.

### Verse 3

Feast after feast thus comes and passes by; Yet, passing points to the glad feast above. Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy, The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
