## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When it's time to say goodby, And tears begin to fall, We leave you in our Father's care protected by His all. Don't ever forget that you are His child, adopted for His own. And when the darkness presses down, You'll never be alone. 

### Verse 2

We have shared our love and joy. God lifted up our hearts. Together we have searched His Word, but now in Him, we part. Don't ever forget that you are His child, adopted for His own. And when the darkness presses down, You'll never be alone. 

### Verse 3

Even tho' we're far apart, we walk within His sight. We'll always be as one in Him, in doing what is right. Don't ever forget that you are His child, adopted for His own. And when the darkness presses down, You'll never be alone.
