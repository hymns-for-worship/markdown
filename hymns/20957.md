# 20957 - SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM

## Notation

C - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Consider the ravens, that sow not, nor reap. Nor store for another day; Yet God in His kindness supplies them their food; Are you not worth more than they?

### Verse 2

Consider the lilies, that toil not, nor spin. Yet dress as a king would do, If God gives such clothes to the grass in the field, What clothes will He give to you?

### Verse 3

Do not be concerned, then, for what you will eat, Or what you will drink, or wear; Your heavenly Father will give you these things; Tomorrow is in His care.

### Chorus

The nations of earth gladly seek all these things, And God knows you need them too; But seek for His kingdom and righteousness first, And all these He’ll add to you.
