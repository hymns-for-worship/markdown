## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus loves me! This I know, For the bible tells me so; Little ones to Him belong, They are weak but He is strong.

### Verse 2

Jesus loves me! He who died, Heaven's gate to open wide; He will wash away my sin, Let His little child come in.

### Verse 3

Jesus, take this heart of mine, Make it pure and wholly Thine; Thou hast bled and died for me: I will henceforth live for Thee.

### Chorus

Yes, Jesus loves me; Yes, Jesus lovs me; Yes, Jesus loves me; The Bible tells me so.
