## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are going down the valley one by one, With our faces tow'rd the setting of the sun; Down the valley where the mournful cypress grows, Where the stream of death in silence onward flows.

### Verse 2

We are going down the valley one by one, When the labors of the weary day are done; One by one, the cares of earth for ever past, We shall stand upon the river bank at last.

### Verse 3

We are going down the valley one by one: Human comrade you or I will there have none; But a tender hand will guide us lest we fall: Christ is going down the valley with us all.

### Chorus

We are going down the valley, Going down the valley, Going tow'rd the setting of the sun; We are going down the valley, Going down the valley, Going down the valley one by one.
