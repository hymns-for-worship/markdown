## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All the way my Savior leads me, Cheers each winding path I tread, Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread, Whether good or ill betide me, Whether skies be dark or clear, Jesus stays so close beside me, That I know and feel Him near.

### Verse 2

Not forever by still waters Would I idly, quiet stay, But would smite the living fountains From the rocks along the way. Though my weary steps may falter And my soul athirst may be, Gushing from the rock before me, Lo! a spring of joy I see.

### Verse 3

Many friends were gathered round me In the bright days of the past, But the grave has closed above them, And I linger here the last, Loved ones gone to be with Jesus, In their robes of white arrayed, Now are waiting for my coming Where the roses never fade.

### Verse 4

While I walk the pilgrim pathway, Clouds will overspread the sky, But when trav'ling days are over, Not a shadow, not a sigh, When my journey is completed, If to God I have been true, Fair and bright the home in glory My enraptured soul will view.
