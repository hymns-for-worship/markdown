## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How many sands on the seashore? How many crickets that sing? How many stars in the heavens? How many birds on the wing? How many fish in the ocean? How many snows on the mount?

### Verse 2

How many pray'rs have been answered? How many tears have ben dried? How many sleeping in Jesus, Abraham's bosom abide? How many wonders of glory, Angels in  heaven recount?

### Verse 3

How many songs of the faithful? How many prophecies done? How many sins are forgiven? How many victories won? How many bountiful blessings Flow from that heavenly fount?

### Chorus

How many gifts from above? Too many to number! Too many to number! Too many to count! Too many to count!
