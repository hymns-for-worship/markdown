## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On this day of calm reflection, We lift up our hearts in praise; We are here by Your protection, Guided safely thru our days. Looking back, we see Your blessing Thru the years Your care has spanned; Lord, Your love, beyond expressing, Brought us here by grace we stand. 

### Verse 2

Now we see the work around us: Walking worthy of Your call; Opportunities surround us; Serving You demands our all. Blessed with knowledge, skill, and treasure, We will work with strength renewed; Taking joy in Your good pleasure, We com-mit our works to You. 

### Verse 3

Down the path that lies before us Mortal eyes may not yet see; Yet Your promises restore us: Where You are, there we shall be. So whereever You may take us, You our guide, our Morning Star, We know You will not forsake us; You have led us safe thus far.
