## Notation

F - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my life on this earth is ended And my body put into the ground; Will I have lived as God wants me? O, where will my soul be found?

### Verse 2

The rich man in hell wanted water, But his lips will stay parched and dry; He could have obeyed while here on earth, But he let his chances pass by. 

### Verse 3

Dear friend don't wait till tomorrow; Don't let this shame pass by; Today is all that we're promised. O, where will you go when you die?

### Chorus

How long is forever? O, what will you do? There's only two choices; which one will you make? Dear friend, we are praying for you.
