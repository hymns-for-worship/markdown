# 20539 - TRUST IN THE LORD

## Notation

Ab - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As troubles try our faith today, Still in the Lord we'll hope and pray While most men fret o'er riches gone; Gods children reap the good seed sown.

### Verse 2

The God who gives all nature's need, Will so much more His children feed; And thru the years tp trusting souls His gifts more precious than pure gold.

### Verse 3

To worry is the Devil's way; But God's word builds our hope each day. Then we must trust His promise true, "I'll ever love and care for you."

### Chorus

Lord, when doubts may cloud my way; And the future seems so dark for me Then with strong faith help me to say With all my heart I'll trust in Thee!
