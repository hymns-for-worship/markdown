## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Another year is dawning! Dear Father, let it be, In working or in waiting, another year with Thee; Another year of leaning upon Thy loving breast, Another year of trusting, of quiet, happy rest.





### Verse 2

Another year of mercies, of faithfulness and grace; Another year of gladness in the shining of Thy face; Another year of progress, another year of praise, Another year of proving Thy presence all the days.



### Verse 3

Another year of service, of witness for Thy love; Another year of training for holier work above. Another year is dawning! Dear Father, let it be On earth, or else in heaven, another year for Thee.
