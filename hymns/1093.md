## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord from Your hand I take the bread, and from Your cup I drink the wine; You serve forgiveness for my need, You serve Your holy life for mine.

### Verse 2

Now from Your lips I hear the words: "This is My body and My blood;" I see the mercy in Your eyes, I see the pain, I see the love.

### Verse 3

I see the cross, I see Your face; My God, what agony and grief! I see You suffer as You die, I hear You pray- It is for me.

### Verse 4

O Jesus, Savior, Holy God! I live and breathe in Your embrace! Lord, ev'ry moment draw my heart To love and serve You face to face.
