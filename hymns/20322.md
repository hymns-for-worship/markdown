## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, and shall it ever be,  A mortal man ashamed of Thee? Ashamed of Thee,  Whom angels praise, Whose glories shine thru endless days? 

### Verse 2

Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far Let ev'ning blush to own a star; He sheds the beams of light divine O'er this benighted soul of mine.

### Verse 3

Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may, When I've no guilt to wash away; No tears to wipe, no good to crave, no fears to quell, no soul to save.

### Verse 4

Till then, nor is my boasting vain,  Till then I boast a Savior slain; And O, may this my glory be, That Christ is not ashamed of me.

### Chorus

And O, may this my glory be, My glory be, my glory be, That Christ is not ashamed of me, Is not ashamed of me.
