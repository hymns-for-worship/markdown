### Verse 1

Make me a servant, Just like Your Son. For He was a servant, Please make me one. Make me a servant, Do what You must do To make me a servant, Make me like You.

### Verse 2

Make me a servant; Take all my pride, For I would be lowly, Humble inside. Giving to others With all that I do; In love for my brother, Make me like You.

### Verse 3

Make me a servant, Filled by Your might, And may all my labors Shine with your light. Show me Your footsteps And what I should do; For now and forever, Make me like You.
