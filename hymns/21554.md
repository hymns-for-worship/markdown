## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord of all being, throned afar, Thy glory flames from sun and star; Center and soul of ev'ry sphere, Yet to each loving heart how near!



### Verse 2

Sun of our life, Thy quick'ning ray sheds on our path the glow of day; Star of our hope, Thy softened light Cheers the long watches of the night.

### Verse 3

Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn; Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn; Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign; All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.
