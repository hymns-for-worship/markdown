## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I survey the world and all its splendor, the heav'ns declare a beautiful array. Yes, we believe our God still rules in heaven; the darkest night He changes back to day.

### Verse 2

Creation speaks of God in all His glory: the meadows, lakes and flow'rs of early spring. Thru life God shows His care for ev'ry creature; such love and pow'r inspires my heart to sing.

### Verse 3

The greatest gift God gave for our salvation; He loved the world by giving His dear Son. The sacrifice He gave for us on Cal'ry, brings life and peace, and hope to ev'ryone.

### Chorus

God's love and pow'r are shown in ev'ry scene; adorning truth on which we can rely. When time is o'er, all earth will then proclaim that Christ is Lord, and King most high.
