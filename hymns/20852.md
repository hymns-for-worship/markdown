# 20852 - HEAR OUR FEEBLE PRAYER

## Notation

E - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We bring our off'rings at Thy feet, off'rings from hearts that cannot speak. Who can begin to tell Thy grace? Who, bowed down with sin, can see Thy face?

### Verse 2

No gift we offer can atone for all the sins that we have known, Only the blood of Your sinless Son, Only such a gift can make us one.

### Verse 3

So, Father, hear our feeble prayer, Offered to You from hearts laid bare. Forgive us of our foolish ways, Hold us in the warmth of Your embrace.
