## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O sing unto God with all of your might, And some heavy heart you will surely delight. Yes, sing when you're happy and sing when you're blue, And count all your blessings, God sent them to you.

### Verse 2

We gather today, we offer our praise, We seek God's approval of the voices we raise. We all sing as one, a glorious sound, And unity finds us, in peace we abound.

### Verse 3

Let us sing with the spirit, understanding, too, And God will send blessings for me and for you. Let's sing Moses' song and the Lamb's by and by, Let us seek our salvation, not a tear or a sigh.

### Verse 4

The body called out the church, is His bride, Together in song, with division denied. Let's follow the Savior, our Lord and our King, What a blessing He gave us when He taught us to sing.

### Verse 5

Old songs bring teardrops, new songs bring pleasure, Not silver or gold, but heaven's treasue. The mountains, the trees, and the robin who sings, God blesses our nation and liberty rings.
