## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a place rest where my soul can sing. In the shadow of my Savior's wings. Sharing in the love of the Lord above, In the shadow of His wings.

### Verse 2

When Your trials here many sorrows bring. Ever closer to the Savior cling. Put your trust in Him tho' the way be dim. In the shadow of His wings.

### Verse 3

I will journey on To that land of song. Where there's endless joy, Eternal spring. To the pearly gate saved ones for us wait. In the shadow of His wings.

### Chorus

In the shadow of His wings, Sheltered from all harm Let me rest in the shade By the cooling stream He's my guiding hand, 'cross the burning sand, Then I'll rest and sing 'neath the Savior's wings.
