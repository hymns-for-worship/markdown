## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's no other name so sweet as Jesus, No one ever cared so much for me; As to shed His precious bloodd to save me, No one cared so much for me.

### Verse 2

When I see Him face to face in glory, I will bow at His nail scarred feet; And I'll thank Him for the pain He suffered, Becaused He cared so much for me

### Chorus

There's no one who cares like Jesus, There's no friend so precious to me; Who would carry a cross up to Calv'ry No one cared so much for me.
