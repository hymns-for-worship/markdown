## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Up Calv'ry's mountain one dreadful morn, walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn; facing for sinners death on the cross, that He might save them from endless loss.

### Verse 2

Father, forgive them! thus did He pray, e'en while His lifeblood flowed fast away; praying for sinners while in such woe no one but Jesus ever loved so.

### Verse 3

O how I love Him, Savior and Friend! How can my praises ever find end! Thro years unnumbered on heaven's shore, my tongue shall praise Him forever more.

### Chorus

Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer! Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree! Wounded and bleeding, for sinner's pleading blind and unheeding, dying for me!
