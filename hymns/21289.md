# 21289 - WHAT I WANT

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I want to know the gospel, To fully understand. I want to have the wisdom To live within this land. I want to learn of Jesus. His will I shall obey, And walk each day beside Him the strait and narrow way.

### Verse 2

I want to be of service to those who need my care. I want to feed the hungry, And clothe those who are bare. I want to preach the gospel to those who're lost in sin, And bring them to salvation that they might live again.

### Verse 3

I want to meet my Father in that sweet home above. I want to sing His praises Before His throne of love. I want to be with Jesus in mansions pure and blessed, And live with Him forever in an eternal rest.

### Chorus

Help me to follow faithful, Your blessed will to do. Father, may I e'er be willing to fully trust in You.
