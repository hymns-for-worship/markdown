## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've read from the Bible the words of my Master, When tempted by Satan had these words to say: "Get thee behind me, Get thee behind me, I serve only God and there's no other way."

### Verse 2

So oft' have I read it, I know Jesus said it; So plainly it's written that I must believe. 'Tis written that Satan will some day be smitten, And never again will he ever deceive.

### Verse 3

I search the fair writ of the mind of Jehovah, And daily I ponder the will of my Lord. He wills that I keep the grim reaper behind me. I must and I shall for I trust in His word. 

### Verse 4

O Lord guide my way as I read the dear pages, Where truth after truth is so wond'rous to see, And each will incite me to stand and declare it. His truths all are written, All writ-ten to me.
