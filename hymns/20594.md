## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O newborn soul, art thou not as the angels? O pretty one, gift of the Father's hand; O soul so pure and suited but for glory How shall we keep, how shall we keep you safe from wiles of man?

### Verse 2

How shall we keep your soul? How can we guide you? But for that gracious hand, we'd fail you sure. But for our God who formed your very being, We could not guard, we could not guard your soul nor keep you pure.

### Verse 3

O newly born, to cherish and to keep you, As God would have us keep you for His own; We've but to pray and say "O Father guide us." Nor will we fear, nor will we fear, He's left us not alone.
