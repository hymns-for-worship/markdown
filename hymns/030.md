## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All things praise Thee, Lord most high, heav'n and earth, and sea and sky; all were for Thy glory made, that Thy greatness, thus displayed, should all worship bring to Thee; all things praise Thee Lord, may we!

### Verse 2

All things praise Thee night to night sing in silent hymns of light; all things praise Thee day by day chants Thy pow'r in burning ray; time and space are praising Thee; all things praise Thee Lord, may we!

### Verse 3

All things praise Thee; heav'n's high shrine rings with melody divine; lowly bending at Thy feet, seraph and archangel meet; this their highest bliss, to be ever praising Lord, may we!
