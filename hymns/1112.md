## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the body of the Lord, We are bound in unity; Just as we are one in God, you are also part of me.

### Verse 2

We are members of His church, made to fill each different role; When we use our gifts for Him, then our works build up the whole.

### Verse 3

When you serve where I cannot, I rejoice in what He's planned: By your strength, our work is done, and we follow His command.

### Chorus

We are one, as we serve in truth and perfect love, All united in one mind with Him above.

### Verse 4

Thus we bear each other's loads till we rest with Him above; All together, we can serve, joined in labor, faith, and love.
