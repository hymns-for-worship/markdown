## Notation

Ab - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Simply trusting every day, Trusting thru a stormy way; Even when my faith is small, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 2

Brightly doth His Spirit shine Into this poor heart of mine; While He leads I cannot fall; Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 3

Singing if my way is clear, Praying if the path be drear; If in danger for Him call; Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 4

Trusting Him while life shall last, Trusting Him till earth be past; Till within the jasper wall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Chorus

Trusting as the moments fly, Trusting as the days go by; Trusting Him whateâ€™er befall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.
