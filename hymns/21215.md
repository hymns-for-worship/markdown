## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who am I that the highest King would welcome me. I was lost but He brought me in. O, His love for me. O, His love for me. Who the Son sets free, O is free in-deed. I'm a child of God, yes I am.

### Verse 2

Free at last, He has ransomed me, His grace runs deep. While I was a slave to sin, Jesus died for me. Yes, He died for me. In my Father's house there's a place for me. I'm a child of God, yes I am. I am chosen, not forsaken. I am who You say I am. You are for me, not against me. I am who You say I am. Who the Son sets free, O is free indeed. I'm a child of God, yes I am.
