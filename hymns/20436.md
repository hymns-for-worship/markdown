## Notation

F - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How far was the road up to Calv'ry? How dark was the night that He died? How heavy the cross that He carried? I'll never know till I stand by His side.

### Verse 2

How hurt was my Lord when He suffered? How lonely was He when betrayed? How much was the debt that He settled? I'll never know but I know that it's paid.

### Verse 3

How sharp were the thorns when they crowned Him? How crushed was His heart when denied? How bruised was His back by the lashes? I'll never know till I stand by His side.

### Verse 4

How cold was the grave where they laid Him? How long was the night He passed thru? How much did He pay to redeem me? I'll never know but I know that it's true.

### Chorus

I'll never know how steep was the mountain, I'll never know till I see Him above; I only know that He sought till He found me, I only know how deep was His love.
