## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a gate that stands ajar, And thru its portals gleaming, A radiance from the cross afar, The Savior's love revealing.

### Verse 2

That gate ajar stands free for all Who seek thru it salvation, The rich and poor, the great and small, Of ev'ry tribe and nation.

### Verse 3

Press onward, then, t ho' foes may frown, While mercy's gate is open; Obey His Word and win the crown, Love's everlasting token.

### Chorus

Yes, in the blood of Christ I see The gate that stands ajar for me; For me, for me, That stands ajar for me.
