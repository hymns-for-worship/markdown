# 20847 - REMIND ME, DEAR LORD

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The things that I love and hold dear to my heart Are just borrowed they're not mine at all. Jesus only let me use them to brighten my life, So remind me, remind me, dear Lord.

### Verse 2

Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own Son; I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands. Yet He chose the road to Calv'ry to die in my stead; Why He loved me, I can't understand.

### Chorus

Roll back the curtain of mem'ry now and then; Show me where you brought me from, and where I could have been; Remember I'm human, and humans forget; So remind me, remind me, dear Lord.
