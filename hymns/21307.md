## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto Me and rest; Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon my breast." I came to Jesus as I was, Weary and worn and sad; I found in Him a resting place, And He has made me glad. 

### Verse 2

I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold, I freely give The living water, thirsty one, Stoop down, and drink, and live." I came to Jesus and I drank Of that lifegiving stream; My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived, And now I live in Him.

### Verse 3

I heard the voice of Jesus say, "I am this dark world's light; Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, And all thy day be bright!" I looked to Jesus and I found In Him my Star, my Sun; And in that light of life I'll walk Till trav'ling days are done.
