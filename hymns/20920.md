## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ told His disciples, "This bread you must eat; And drink of this cup, too, in mem'ry of Me. As oft as you do this My death you proclaim. Discerning My body Till I come again."



### Verse 2

Betrayed and arrested, They mocked Him and lied; Took Jesus to Pilate, and cried, "Cru cify."  The soldiers then scourged Him, He carried His cross, They led Him to Calv'ry, To die on that cross.

### Verse 3

I try to imagine, I try hard to see, The day they nailed Jesus To that cruel tree. The curse that He bore there, He suffered for me. By dying He purchased salvation for me.
