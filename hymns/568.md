## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I want to be a soul winner for Jesus ev'ry day, He does so much for me; I want to aid the lost sinner to leave his erring way, And be from bondage free.

### Verse 2

 I want to be a soul winner and bring the lost to Christ, That they His grace may know; I want to live for Christ ever, and do His blessed will, Because He loves me so. A

### Verse 3

 I want to be a soul winner till Jesus calls for me, To lay my burdens down; I want to hear Him say, "Servant, you've gathered many sheaves, Receive a shining crown."

### Chorus

A soul winner for Jesus, A soul winner for Jesus, O let me be each day, A soul winner for Jesus, A soul winner for Jesus, He's done so much for me.
