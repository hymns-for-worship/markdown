## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O holy city, seen of John, Where Christ, the Lamb, doth reign, Within whose foursquare walls shall come No night, nor need, nor pain, And where the tears are wiped from eyes That shall not weep again.

### Verse 2

O shame to us who rest content While lust and greed for gain In street and shop and tenement Wring gold from human pain, And bitter lips in blind despair Cry, "Christ hath died in vain!"

### Verse 3

Give us, O God, the strength to build The City that hath stood Too long a dream, whose laws are love, Whose ways are brotherhood, And where the sun that shineth is God's grace for human good.

### Verse 4

Already in the mind of God That city riseth fair: Lo, how its splendor challenges The souls that greatly dare, Yea, bids us seize the whole of life And build its glory there.
