## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away; To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.

### Verse 2

 When the shadows of this life have grown, fly away; Like a bird from prison bars has flown, fly away, fly away.

### Verse 3

 Just a few more weary days and then, fly away,  To a land where joys shall never end,

### Chorus

I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away; When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away.
