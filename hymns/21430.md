## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are lonely hearts to cherish, While the days are going by; There are weary souls who perish, While the days are going by; If a smile we can renew, As our journey we pursue, O the good we all may do, While the days are going by.

### Verse 2

All the loving links that bind us. While the days are going by; One by one we leave behine us, While the days are going by; But the seeds of good we sow, Both in shade and shine will grow, And will keep our hearts aglow, While the days are going by.

### Chorus

Going by, going by, Going by, going by; O the good we all may do, While the days are going by.
