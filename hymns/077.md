## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I must tell Jesus all of my trials; I cannot bear these burdens alone; in my distress He kindly will help me; He ever loves and cares for His own.

### Verse 2

I must tell Jesus all of my troubles; He is a kind, compassionate friend; if I but ask Him, He will deliver, make of my troubles quickly an end.

### Verse 3

Tempted and tried I need a great Savior; one who can help my burdens to bear; I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus; He all my cares and sorrows will share.

### Verse 4

O how the world to evil allures me! O how my heart is tempted to sin! I must tell Jesus and He will help me over the world and victory to win.

### Chorus

I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus! I cannot bear my burdens alone; I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus! Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
