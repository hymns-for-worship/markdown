## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Love divine, all loves excelling, Joy of heav'n, to earth come down!  Fix in us Thy humble dwelling, All Thy faithful mercies crown; Jesus, Thou art all compassion, Pure, unbounded love Thou art; Visit us with Thy salvation, Enter ev'ry trembling heart!

### Verse 2

 Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit Into ev'ry troubled breast; May we all in Thee inherit; May we find the promised rest; Take away the love of sinning, Take our load of guilt away; End the work of Thy beginning, Bring us to eternal day. 

### Verse 3

 Come, Almighty to deliver, May we all Thy life receive; Suddenly return, and never, Nevermore Thy temples leave; Thee we would be always blessing, Serve Thee as Thy hosts above, Pray, and praise Thee, without ceasing, Glory in Thy perfect love. 

### Verse 4

 Finish then Thy new creation, Pure, unspotted, may we be; May we see our whole salvation Perfectly secured by Thee; Changed from glory, into glory, Till in heav'n we take our place, Till we cast our crowns before Thee, Lost in wonder, love and praise.
