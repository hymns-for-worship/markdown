## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Son of God, eternal Savior, Source of life and truth and grace. Son of Man, whose birth incarnate Hallows all our human race. You, our Head, enthroned in glory, For the church will ever plead. Fill us with Your love and pity, Heal our wrongs and help our need.

### Verse 2

Lord, as You have lived for others, So may we for others live. Freely have Your gifts been granted, Freely may Your servants give. Is there want, or pain, or sorrow? Make us all the burden share. Are there spirits crushed and broken? Teach us Lord, to soothe their care.

### Verse 3

Bind us all as one together In Your church's sacred fold. Weak and healthy, poor, and wealthy, Sad and joyful, young and old. As You pray and as You will it That Your people should be one. Grant our hope to be united, Here on earth Your will be done.
