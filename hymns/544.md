## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave, "Send the light! Send the light!" There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save, 

### Verse 2

 We have heard the Macedonian call today, "Send the light! Send the light!" And a golden off'ring at the cross we lay, 

### Verse 3

 Let us pray that grace may ev'rywhere abound; "Send the light! Send the light!" And a Christlike spirit ev'rywhere be found,

### Verse 4

 Let us not grow weary in the work of love, "Send the light! Send the light!" Let us gather jewels for a crown above, 

### Chorus

Send the light! the blessed gospel light; Let it shine from shore to shore! Send the light! the blessed gospel light; Let it shine forever more.
