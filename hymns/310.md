## Lyrics

### Verse 3

Why keep Jesus pleading? Pleading at the door? He will be your savior, ever, ever more; love him, soul, and open, open, I implore.

### Verse 2

Why keep Jesus waiting? Waiting at the door? Of the knocketh softly, softly o'er and o'er; hear him, soul, and open, open, I implore.

### Verse 1

Why keep Jesus waiting? Waiting in the cold? He will bear you gently, gently to his fold; see him, soul, and open, open, I implore.

### Verse 4

Why keep Jesus waiting, knocking at the door? Soon he'll cease his pleading, yes forever more; come, poor soul obey him, open I implore.
