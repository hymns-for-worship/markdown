# 21647 - THEY CRUCIFIED MY LORD

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 3+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

They tried the Savior. No guilt had He but love for sinners, All lost, like me. They took Barabas, And set him free. The wicked tried my Lord.






### Verse 2

They mocked the Master. No shame His due, or all the insults My Savior knew. With thorns they crowned Him, "Hail, King of Jews!" O, how they mocked my Lord.

### Verse 3

They crucified Him. Can words so brief tell of the sorrow, My greatest grief? Christ in the center, Each side a thief. They crucified my Lord.

### Chorus

They tried the Savior without a cause. They mocked the Master for who He was. They crucified Him, King on a cross. They crucified my Lord.
