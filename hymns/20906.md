### Verse 1

Take the world, but give me Jesus, All its joys are but a name; But His love abideth ever, Thru eternal years the same.

### Verse 2

Take the world, but give me Jesus, In His cross my trust shall be; Till, with clearer, brighter vision, Face to face my Lord I see.

O, the height and depth of mercy! O, the length and breadth of love! O, the fullness of redemption, Pledge of endless life above!
