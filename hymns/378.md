## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus' name. 

### Verse 2

 When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace; In ev'ry high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil. 

### Verse 3

 His oath, His covenant, His blood, Support me in the whelming flood; When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. 

### Verse 4

 When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found, Dressed in His righteousness alone, Faultless to stand before the throne. 

### Chorus

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, All other ground is sinking sand. 

### Coda

Amen.
