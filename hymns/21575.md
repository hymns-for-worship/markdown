## Notation

D - 3/4 on 2+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My sin is great, my strength is weak, My path beset with snares; But Thou, O Christ, hast died for me, And Thou wilt hear my prayer.


### Verse 2

The world is dark without Thee, Lord, I turn me from its strife To find Thy love a sweet relief; Thou art the light of life.

### Verse 3

Temptations lure and fears assail My frail, inconstant heart; But precious are Thy promises, And they new strength impart.

### Verse 4

Unfold Thy precepts to my mind, And cleanse my blinded eyes; Grant me to work for Thee on earth, Then praise Thee in the skies.


### Chorus

To Thee, to Thee, the Crucified, The sinner's only plea. Relying on Thy promised grace, My faith still clings to Thee.
