## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Holy Bible, Book divine, Precious treasure, thou art mine; Mine to tell me whence I came; Mine to teach me what I am.

### Verse 2

Mine to chide me when I rove; Mine to show a Savior's love; Mine thou art to guide and guard; Mine to punish or reward.

### Verse 3

Mine to comfort in distress, Suff'ring in this wilderness; Mine to show, by living faith, Man can triumph over death.

### Verse 4

Mine to tell of joys to come, And the rebel sinner's doom; O thou holy Book divine, Precious treasure, thou art mine.
