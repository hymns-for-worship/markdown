## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ, the Lord, was born in a stable; Inside a city called Bethlehem. Little Babe in a lowly manger, But He was Lord 'fore the world began.

### Verse 2

Christ, the Lord, fed many people, Healing the sick by His mighty hand. Tho He did many signs and wonders, He came to earth for a greater plan.

### Verse 3

Christ, the Lord, is our Redeemer; He took away all the sins of man. 'Tween two thieves Jesus died on Calv'ry; Rose from the grave to live again.

### Chorus

Christ, the Lord, He is our Savior; Lamb of God! Son of man! Christ, the Lord, is our Redeemer. He reigns in heav'n at His Father's right hand.

### Verse 4

Christ, the Lord, enthroned in heaven, Waiting the day to come back again. On that day ev'ry eye will see Him; Both saved and lost, ev'ry knee shall bend.

### Coda

Christ the King! He is our Lord!
