## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed is the man, who regards with disdain, all the vain unholy words of the wicked and profane. He will never stand with the evil and the vile, sit with men who laugh at God, joining those who speak with guile.

### Verse 2

All the night and day, he delights in the Word, loves reflecting on the law, where the mind of God is heard. He is like a tree with a river flowing by, holds the pleasure in its fruit, tho' the wind is hot and dry.

### Verse 3

Blessed man of God, has all faith he will see, all good things will come to him, like the green and fruited tree. Sinners have no peace and will never be secure, ever blowing in the wind, wayward souls will not endure.

### Verse 4

Judgment day will come, sin will have no reward, for the sinner has no place with the people of the Lord. Those who sin will fall, and forever more will pay, but the Lord knows all His own, and will guide them all the way.
