## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My eyes are dry, My faith is old, My heart is hard, My pray'rs are cold. And I know how I ought to be, Alive to You and dead to me. What can be done to an old heart like mine? Soften it up with oil and wine. The oil is You, Your spirit of love. Please wash me anew in the wine of Your blood. 

### Verse 2

My songs are cold, my pray'rs are dust; My vision gone. I've lost my trust. But still I know  A What can be done to an old heart like mine? live to You and dead to me. how life should be: Soften it up with oil and wine. The oil is You, Your spirit of love. Please wash me anew in the wine of Your blood. 

### Verse 3

Your grace has covered all my sin, And now Your presence reigns within. I am redeemed! I've been set free! Alive to You and dead to me. Look what You've done to this old heart of mine! Softened it up with oil and wine. The oil is You, Your spirit of love. You've washed me anew in the wine of Your blood.
