## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Must I live a life of sinning just to know God will forgive me? Must I then be brokenhearted just to know that He can cheer me?

### Verse 2

Must I be in heav'n with Him just to know the Lord is reigning? Must I see His acts of power, just ot know that He is with me?

### Verse 3

Must my prayers be loudly spoken just to know the Father hears me? Must I die with no one knowing just to know the Father sees me?

### Verse 4

Must I see the King leave heaven just to keep my hopeful yearning? Must I watch with perfect vision just to know that He's returning?

### Chorus

Praise the Lord! I am forgiven, and my Father up in heaven knows and hears and will be with me; praise the Lord! I am His child!
