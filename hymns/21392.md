## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My life flows on in endless song; Above earth's lamentation I hear the real tho' faroff hymn That hails a new creation: Thru all the tumult and the strife I hear its music ringing; It sounds an echo in my soul. How can I keep from singing?

### Verse 2

What tho' the tempest loudly roars? The Lord my Savior liveth, And tho' the darkness 'round me close, Songs in the night He giveth. No storm can shake my inmost calm While to that rock I'm clinging. Since Christ is Lord of heav'n and earth, How can I keep from singing?

### Verse 3

When tyrants tremble in their fear And hear their death knell ringing, When friends rejoice both far and near, How can I keep from sing-ing? In prison cell and dungeon vile Our tho'ts to them are winging; When friends by shame are undefiled, How can I keep from singing?
