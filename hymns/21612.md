## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Christ, the healer, we have come To pray for health, to plead for friends. How can we fail to be restored When reached by love that never ends?



### Verse 2

From ev'ry ailment flesh endures Our bodies clamor to be freed, Yet in our hearts we would confess That wholeness is our deepest need.



### Verse 3

In conflicts that destroy our health We recognize the world's disease; Our common life declares our ills. Is there no cure, O Christ, for these?



### Verse 4

Grant that we all, made one in faith, In Your community may find The wholeness that, enriching us, Shall reach and prosper humankind.
