## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Saved ones in glory are waiting for me, Just inside the gate; Some golden morning their faces I'll see,   There will be shouting and singing up there, Glory forever with them we shall share, When we shall enter our mansion so fair, Inside the gate. 

### Verse 2

 Wonderful music there surely will be, Just inside the gate; All the sweet singers of heaven we'll see, inside the We shall rejoice while the ages shall roll, Joining with angels His name to extol, There in the beautiful home of the soul, Just 

### Verse 3

  We shall see Jesus, O praise His dear name, Just inside the gate; All thru the ages His grace we'll proclaim,  Angels and saved ones are looking this way, Hop ing to greet us some wonderful day, When we move over to heaven to stay, 

### Chorus

Inside the home gate, Where saints for me wait With angels of light all robed in pure white, 'Twill be a glad day, A wonderful day When we enter that home Just inside, inside the gate.
