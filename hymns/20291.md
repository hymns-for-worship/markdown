## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 2

All my hopes have been raised, O His name be praised, His glory has filled my soul; I've been lifted up and from sin set free, His blood hath made me whole.

### Verse 1

Â I am happy today and the sun shines bright, The clouds have been rolled away; For the Savior said whosoever will, May come with Him to stay

### Verse 3

O what wonderful love, O what grace divine, That Jesus should die for me; I was lost in sin, for the world I pined, But now I am set free. 

### Chorus

Whosoever surely meaneth me,  Surely meaneth me, O surely meaneth me; "Whosoever" surely meaneth me, "Whosoever" meaneth me.
