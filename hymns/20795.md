## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! O may will be mine; Into Thy hand of love I would my all resign; Thru sorrow and thur joy, Conduct as Thine own, And help me still to say, "My Lord,Thy will be done."

### Verse 2

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! If needy here oand poor; Give me Thy people's bread, Their portion reach and sure; The manna of thy word, Let my soul feed upon. And if all else should fail, "My Lord,Thy will be done."

### Verse 3

 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Tho' seen thru many a tear; Let not my star of hope Grow dim or disappear; Since Thou on earth hast wept And sorrowed oft alone, If I must weep with Thee,  "My Lord,Thy will be done."

### Verse 4

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! All shall be well with me; Each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee; Straight to my home above I travel calmly on And sing, in life or death, "My Lord,Thy will be done."
