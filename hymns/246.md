## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Up to the bountiful giver of life, gathering home! Gathering home! Up to the dwelling where cometh no strife, the dear ones are gathering home.

### Verse 2

Up to the city where falleth no night, gathering home! Gathering home! Up where the saviors own face is the light, the saved ones are gathering home.

### Verse 3

Up to the beautiful mansions above, gathering home! Gathering home! Safe in the arms of his infinite love, the dear ones are gathering home.

### Chorus

Gathering home! Gathering home! Never to sorrow more, never to roam; gathering home! Gathering home! God's children are gathering home.
