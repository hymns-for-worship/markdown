## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 4+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I was not on the journey up to Golgotha's hill, Nor was I in the garden that night when time stood still; I did not sell the Savior unto the angry crowd, Nor hear the words as Simon denied the Lord aloud.

### Verse 2

 I did not see the lightning as it flashed on that sad day, Nor help the woman, Mary, place spices where He lay; I live my life much later and in a diff'rent land, But as I sin, I drive again a nail into His hand.

### Verse 3

 I know my Savior loves me, He gave His life so free, Upon the cross of Calv'ry He died for you and me; Let's live our lives for Jesus, don't crucify again, Give praise and honor to the Lord, and hold His nail-scarred hand.
