# 9237 - Mighty Is The Mortal Tongue

## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How mighty is the mortal tongue To teach the lost of God's dear Son; To lift our voice in joyful praise and move our God by prayers we raise. 

### Verse 2

How mighty is the mortal tongue By loving words to cheer someone; And help a soul weighed down with care, and thus his heavy burdens share.

### Verse 3

How mighty is the mortal tongue, When rash words are like arrows flung; To curse those in God's image made, Our precious Lord is thus betrayed.

### Verse 4

How mighty is the mortal tongue, Great good or ill by it is done. Le's make our aim the tongue to hold, And praise our God with heart and soul.

### Coda

Lord, help me guard my tongue today, Lest by my words I offend and stray. A purer heart the world would see, More like my Savior I would be.
