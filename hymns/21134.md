### Verse 1

Lord, I come, I confess. Bowing here, I find my rest. And without You, I fall apart. You're the One that guides my heart. Lord, I need You, O, I need You. Ev'ry hour I need You. My one defense, my righteousness, O God, how I need You. Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more. Where grace is found is where You are. And where You are, Lord, I am free. Holiness is Christ in me. Where You are, Lord, I am free. Holiness is Christ in me. So teach my song to rise to You when temptation comes my way, and when I cannot stand I'll fall on You. Jesus, You're my hope and stay. And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You. Jesus, You're my hope and stay. Lord, I need You, O, I need You. Ev'ry hour I need You. My one defense, my righteousness, O God, how I need You. My You. need You, O, I need You. Ev'ry hour I need You. My one defense, my righteousness, O God, how I need one defense, my righteousness, O God, how I need You.
