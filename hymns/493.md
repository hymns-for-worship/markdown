## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day Day I will never forget! After I'd wandered in darkness away, Jesus my Savior, I met. O, what a tender compassionate Friend! He met the need of my heart; Shadows dispelling, With joy I am telling, He made all the darkness depart!

### Verse 2

 Now I've a hope that will surely endure After the passing of time; I have a future in heaven for sure, There in those mansions sublime. And it's because of that wonderful day When at the Cross I believed; Riches eternal And blessings supernal From His precious hand I received. 

### Chorus

Heaven came down and glory gilled my soul. When at the Cross the Savior made me whole. My sins were washed away And my night was turned to day. Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.
