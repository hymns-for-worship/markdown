### Verse 1

Let the Lord be praised, O Zion! Magnify His holy name, In triumphant adoration, Far and near His praise proclaim.



### Verse 2

Shout aloud, ye hosts victorious, Conquer'rs in His worthy cause, Spare ye not the homage due Him, Look not for the world's applause.



### Verse 3

Praise Him, all creation, praise Him, Heav'n and earth unite and sing Praises of this mighty Ruler, Whom the angels crowned their King.

Prince of Peace, o'er death victorious, Countless hosts their voices raise, Hear the cry from the walls of Zion, "Let the Lord be praised."
