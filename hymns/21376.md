## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Look, ye saints! The sight is glorious: See the Man of Sorrows now, From the fight returned victorious; Every knee to Him shall bow; Crown Him, crown Him, Crown Him, crown Him! Crowns become the Victor's brow!

### Verse 2

Crown the Savior! Angels, crown Him! Rich the trophies Jesus brings. In the seat of pow'r enthrone Him, While the vault of heaven rings; Crown Him, crown Him, Crown Him, crown Him! Crown the Savior King of kings!

### Verse 3

Hark, those bursts of acclamation! Hark, those loud triumphant chords! Jesus takes the highest station; O, what joy the sight affords! Crown Him, crown Him, Crown Him, crown Him! King of kings and Lord of lords!
