## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where on earth may joy be found? In the midst of sinfulness? In God's Word the truth abounds; He provides the rest; If you have been raised with Christ, Seek the things in heaven's realm, Only follow God's advice; He will lead you home.

### Verse 2

This old world has naught for you, With its sorrow, pain and sin; You have died to sin, be true; You are hid in Him. Christ shall come to claim His own, In the midst of toil and strife, Crowned with glory we'll be home; He will give us life.

### Chorus

Set your mind on things above, Not on all that's here below; Keep your heart in Spirit's love And the blessings He'll bestow.
