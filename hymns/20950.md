# 20950 - GO, LABOR ON

## Notation

Bb - 2/2 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Go, labor on: spend, and be spent Thy joy to do the Father's will; It is the way the Master went: Should not the servant tread it still?

### Verse 2

Go, labor on: 'tis not for naught Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain; Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; The Master praises: what are men?

### Verse 3

Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray; Be wise the erring soul to win; Go forth into the world's highway, Compel the wand'rer to come in.

### Verse 4

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice; For work comes rest, for exile home; Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice, The midnight peal, "Behold, I come."
