## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are many paths thru this world of  there's only one I shall travel in; 'Tis the old Cross Road, or the way called "Straight," There is just one way to the pearly gate.

### Verse 2

There are some who sneer at the old Cross Road, At the pearly gate, and the soul's abode; Yet I mind them not, but, with happy song, Of assurance sweet, still I press along.

### Verse 3

Others risk their souls on some newmade way, Thinking they will come to the gate some day; O, may they find out, ere their lives are done, That the old Cross Road is the only one.

### Chorus

There is just one way to the pearly gate, To the crown of life and the friends who wait; 'Tis the old Cross Road, or the way called "Straight," There is just one way to the pearly gate.
