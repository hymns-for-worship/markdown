# 20922 - INCREASE MY FAITH

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 3+ - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Your only Son, You gave to die, For in my sin, You heard my cry. Without my Savior's precious blood My soul is lost, beneath the flood.

### Verse 2

My foolish ways I cannot hide, And yet You linger at my side; To lean on You in times of doubt, To trust and not be left without. 

### Verse 3

In faith I hide my life in Thee, From sin and doubt please help me flee. Your grace sufficient for my need, In pleasant pastures let me feed. 

### Chorus

Increase my faith, O Lord, I pray; Help me to trust thruout each day. Your promises I count so dear; Forgive, dear Lord, and hold me near.
