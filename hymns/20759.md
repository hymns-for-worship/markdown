## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Complete in Thee! no work of mine Could take, dear Lord, the place of Thine; Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, And I shall stand complete in Thee!



### Verse 2

Complete in Thee each want supplied, And no good thing to me denied; Since Thou my portion, Lord, will be, I ask no more, complete in Thee!



### Chorus

Yea, justified! O blessed thought! And sanctified! Salvation wrought! Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, And glorified, I too, shall be.

### Verse 3

 Complete in Thee! no more shall sin, Thy grace has conquered, reign within; Thy blood shall bid the tempter flee, And I shall stand complete in Thee!



### Verse 4

Dear Savior, when before Thy bar All tribes and tongues assembled are, Among Thy chosen I will be, At Thy right hand, complete in Thee!
