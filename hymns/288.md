### Verse 1

I've wandered far away from God, now I'm coming home; the paths of sin too long have trod, Lord I'm coming home.

### Verse 2

I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord, now I'm coming home; I'll trust thy love, believe thy word, Lord, I'm coming home.

### Verse 3

I need his cleansing blood, I know, now I'm coming home; o wash me whiter than the snow, Lord, I'm coming home.

Coming home, coming home, never more to roam; open wide the arms of love, lord, I'm coming home.
