## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Father kind above Sent forth in tender love His Spirit in a measure: A gift divinely free, In ev'ry heart to be A comfort and a treasure.

### Verse 2

Within our hearts shall be This fountain pure and free Of living waters springing: And ev'ry tender grace Shall flourish in the place While songs of joy are ringing.

### Chorus

The gift of the Spirit, In gently falling show'rs descending from above, Shall we not receive it Sent to us from God in love? Our hearts all renewing, So peaceful and so pure, so beautiful and bright, Our lives all bedewing With its holy joy and light.
