## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lo! He comes with clouds descending, Once for favored sinners slain; Thousand thousand saints attending, Swell the triumph of His train; Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Je-sus Christ shall ever reign.

### Verse 2

Ev'ry eye shall now behold Him Robed in dreadful majesty; Those who set at naught and sold Him, Pierced and nailed Him to the tree, Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing, Shall the true Messiah see.

### Verse 3

Yea, Amen! Let all adore Thee, High on Thine exalted throne; Savior! Take Thy pow'r and glory, Claim the kingdoms for Thine own: Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Quickly, Lord, O quickly come!
