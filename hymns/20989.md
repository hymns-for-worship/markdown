## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm climbing the mountains, the mountains of faith Each day I get closer to the heavenly gate Where Jesus, my Savior, is waiting for me And that's why I'm climbing: so heaven I'll see.

### Verse 2

I want to see Jesus, make heaven my home I want to see Jesus, no more shall I roam Tho' none may go with me, I'll look for Him there I want to see Jesus, His glory to share.

### Verse 3

I want to see heaven; walk streets of gold I want to see heaven and riches untold I want to see loved ones who've gone on before I want to see heaven and sorrow no more.

### Chorus

I'm following Jesus from here to glory; I know He saved me, I'm heavenward bound; In that bright homeland, I'll praise Him forever; I'm following Jesus; I'll receive a crown.
