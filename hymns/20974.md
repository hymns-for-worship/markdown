## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound is to my soul, That I should be from sin set free. Once I was lost but now I'm found. Forevermore, amazing grace has rescued me. Now by that grace I am redeemed, Once I was blind But now I see. Ten thousand years, and then forevermore, Amazing grace shall be my plea. 

### Verse 2

Twas precious grace that paid the ransom for my soul. How could He love a wretch like me? Bought by the blood of Christ, the Lamb. Forevermore, amazing grace, O Lord, how sweet. Now by that grace I am redeemed, Once I was blind But now I see. Ten thousand years, and then forevermore, Amazing grace shall be my plea.
