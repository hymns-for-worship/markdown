## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I hear the words of love, I gaze upon the blood, I see the mighty sacrifice, and I have peace with God.




### Verse 2

Tis everlasting peace, sure as Jehovah's name; 'Tis stable as His steadfast throne, for evermore the same.


### Verse 3

The clouds may go and come, and storms may sweep my sky; This bloodsealed friendship changes not, the cross is ever nigh

### Verse 4

.I changeâ€” He changes not; the Christ can never die; His love, not mine, the restingplace; His truth, not mine, the tie.



### Verse 5

My love is ofttimes low, my joy still ebbs and flows, But peace with Him remains the same; no change Jehovah knows.
