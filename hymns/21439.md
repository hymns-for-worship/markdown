### Verse 1

Abba, Father! Abba, Father! By Your grace I'm reconciled, For You found me, freely loved me, Washed me clean and called me "child."

### Verse 2

Abba, Father! Abba, Father! Who am I that I should be Fellow heir with the Begotten, Chosen for Your family?

### Verse 3

Abba, Father! Abba, Father! By Your grace I lift each prayer, Knowing You will bend to listen, To my smallest joy or care.

### Verse 4

Abba, Father! Abba, Father! Yours at last, and this I know: That to love as You have loved me, In Your likeness I must grow.

### Chorus

A child of God! I sing this song: I am adopted, I belong! Loved and chosen, child of promise. Abba, Father, I am Yours!
