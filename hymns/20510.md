## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I feel You in my heart; I see You in my mind. The perfect world You left; The Savior that has died. The awsome earth You've made; From rocky mountain peaks To rushing waters that roll by. But all this can't compare To the glory that's up there. And, Lord, I cannot wait to be inside of heaven's gate.
