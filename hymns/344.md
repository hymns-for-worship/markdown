# 344 - Who At My Door Is Standing

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who at my door is standing, patiently drawing near; entrance within demanding? Whose is the voice I hear?

### Verse 2

Lonely without he's staying, lonely within am I, while I am still delaying, I am condemned to die.

### Verse 3

Door of my heart I hasten! Thee will I open wide; tho he rebuke and chasten, he shall with me abide.

### Chorus

Sweetly the tones are falling; open the door for me! If thou wilt heed my calling, I will abide with thee.
