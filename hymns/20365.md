## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Crown of thorns, body torn, oppressed, condemned to die; A tender man, He's God's own Lamb and mercy's sacrifice. 

### Verse 2

Humble King, suffering for crimes that I have done; Driven nails and scourge, God's justice served by mercy's sacrifice.

### Verse 3

Gift of grace, God's own face and heaven open wide; And the evil one is overcome by mercy's sacrifice.

### Verse 4

Majesty serving me with hands held out in love; So I run to You and fall into the everlasting arms.
