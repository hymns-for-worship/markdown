### Verse 1

Closer to Thee, near to Thy side, closer dear Lord, I would abide; hold me in Thy embrace, 'neath every smile of grace, grant me, Thy child, a place closer to Thee.

### Verse 2

Closer to Thee, near to Thy breast, closer to Thee; Lord, let me rest; guide me when I would stray, keep me from sin each day, draw me, dear Lord, I pray, closer to Thee.

Closer to Thee, happy and free, grant me, o Lord, ever to be; hear me in every cry, stand near when I must die, then take me home on high, closer to Thee.
