# 9221 - O Come, Lord Jesus

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We trust not wealth that man can destroy, But wealth in heav'n where none may annoy. Nor seek sin's joys which ruin the soul, Eternal joy and peace are our goal.

### Verse 2

We seek not praise that man can award, But crown of life that comes from our Lord. We find no joy in pledges of men, But trust His words: "I'm coming again."

### Verse 3

We see not life in this sinful land, But home that's built by His loving hand. We look ahead with no doubt or fear, But strong in faith that Christ will appear.

### Chorus

O come, dear Lord, we eagerly wait. Receive us, Lord, at the heavenly gate.

### Verse 4

We hope to meet the Lord in the air, And ever feel His love and His care; With praise to Father, Spirit and Son; That our great bliss and glories are won.
