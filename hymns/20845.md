## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is joy in heav'n among the angels, When a wanderer returns to the fold, When he comes to seek a place of safety, After straying in the dark and cold.

### Verse 2

There is joy on earth among the righteous, There are faithful hearts that thrill with delight When a soul is given to the Savior, Led to trust the gentle Shepherd's might.

### Verse 3

You can give that joy to saints and angels, For the loving Shepherd calls you today. Heav'n and earth will call to bid you welcome, Do not linger, do not longer stray.

### Chorus

There is joy among the angels, There is joy among the angels when a wanderer returns; There is joy among the angels, When a wanderer returns to the fold.
