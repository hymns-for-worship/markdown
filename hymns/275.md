# 275 - Am I A Soldier Of The Cross

## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Am I a soldier of the cross, a follower of the Lamb, and shall I fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name?

### Verse 2

Must I be carried by the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed thru bloody seas?

### Verse 3

Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this dark world afraid to grace, to help me on to God?

### Verse 4

Sure I must fight if I would reign, increase my courage, Lord, I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy word.
