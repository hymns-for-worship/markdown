## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What heavenly music steals over the sea! Entrancing the senses like sweet melody! 'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air; For me they are singing; Their welcome I hear.


### Verse 2

On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand, And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand; Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray! Let me join that sweet music; Come, take me away.







### Verse 3

Tho' dark are the waters and rough is the wave, If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave; For that heavenly music hath ravished me so, I must join in that chorus! I'll go! Let me go!
