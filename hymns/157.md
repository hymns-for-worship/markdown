## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Alas, and did my savior bleed, and did my sov'reign die? Would He devote that sacred head for such a one as I?

### Verse 2

Was it for crimes that I have done He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity, grace unknown! And love beyond degree!

### Verse 3

Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut His glories in, when Christ, the mighty maker died, for man the creature's sin.

### Verse 4

But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe; here, Lord, I give myself away, tis all that I can do!

### Chorus

At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light, and the burdens of my heart rolled away, it was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day!
