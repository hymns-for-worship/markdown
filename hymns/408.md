## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Search me, O God, and know my heart today, Try me, O Savior, know my thoughts, I pray; See if there be some wicked way in me; Cleanse me from ev'ry sin, and set me free.

### Verse 2

 I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin, Fulfill Thy word, and make me pure within; Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame, Grant me desire to magnify Thy name.

### Verse 3

 Lord, take my life, and make it wholly Thine, Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine; Take all my will, my passion, self and pride, I now surrender, Lord, in me abide. 

### Verse 4

O Lord above, revival comes from Thee, Send a revival start the work in me; Thy word declares Thou wilt supply our need, For blessing now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
