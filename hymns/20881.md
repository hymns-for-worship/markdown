## Lyrics

### Verse 2

Jesus only Savior, sent from above. Jesus only Savior poured out His love. From Calvary's hill, He bought what was lost. Jesus only Savior, paid the great cost.

### Verse 3

Soul, O precious soul, a home there awaits; Soul, O precious soul, at Heaven's bright gate. Adrift and alone my spirit has strayed. Soul, O precious soul, God's pointing the way.

### Verse 1

Soul, O precious soul, O spirit of man. Soul, O precious soul, 'tis touched by God's hand. His Spirit entreats and shows you the Way. Soul, O precious soul, God calls you this day.

### Chorus

Blood, O precious blood, A ransom for my soul. Shed by Jesus for sins new and old. O, how can it be that He did this for me? Soul, O precious soul, God's calling to thee.
