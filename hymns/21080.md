## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O if my house is built upon a rock, I know it will stand for ever; The floods may come and the rolling thundershock May beat upon my house That is built upon a rock.

### Verse 2

For He whose truth is lasting as the hills, Whose word is unchanging ever; Hath said my house on the solid rock shall stand; He'll hold it by His might In the hollow of His hand.

### Chorus

And 'twill never fall, Never fall, Never, never, never; Its foundation is sure, And will stand forevermore, Yes, it will stand for ever.
