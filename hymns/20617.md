### Verse 1

Soul, are you weary of life's heavy load? Cast all your burdens on Jesus! Have you grown heartsick and faint on the road? Cast all your burdens on Him.

### Verse 2

Have you grown tired of the toil's of the day? Cast all your burdens on Jesus! You will find rest at the end of the way; Cast all your burdens on Him.

### Verse 3

O that your soul may not faint in despair; Cast all your burdens on Jesus! Think of the rest that awaits you up there; Cast all your burdens on Him.

### Chorus

Cast all your burdens on Jesus! Take ev'ry sorrow to Him; Ask Him in pray'r, He your troubles will share, Cast all your burdens on Him.
