## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Weary one, be ye spotless and whiter than snow, Let the grace of our Lord fill your soul. Do you know if today, should He call you away, You've a place not reserved in His fold?

### Verse 2

Know ye not of the woe in the way that you go? Know ye not of the grief and decay? Will he say, at the end of your long earthly day, "Come My child and I'll show you the way"?

### Chorus

Will you trust the Messiah to give your heart ease? Will you trust Him your soul to receive? For He knows all your sorrows and sees all Your needs Bow and say, "Yes, my Lord, I believe," Bow and say, "Yes, my Lord, I believe."
