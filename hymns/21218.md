## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ is the world's light, He and no other; Born in our darkness, He became our brother. If we have seen Him, we have seen the Father: Glory to God on high!

### Verse 2

Christ is the world's peace, He and no other; No one can serve Him and despise another. Who else unites us, one in God the Father? Glory to God on high!

### Verse 3

Christ is the world's life, He and no other; Sold once for silver, murdered here, our brother. He who redeems us reigns with God the Father: Glory to God on high!
