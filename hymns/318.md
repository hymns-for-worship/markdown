# 318 - Where Livest Thou

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where livest thou in pleasures of the world? Or in that realm whence satan's darts are hurled? Choose now to follow with the sons of God; far better this than where the great have trod.

### Verse 2

Where livest thou? In malice and in strife? Where darkness veils and mars the righteous life? Choose now to make a living sacrifice  tis better thus; for we belong to christ.

### Verse 3

Where livest thou? There is a place to stay, tis in the christ, the true and living way! Within his kingdom, labor while you may; hear what he says, in loyal trust obey.
