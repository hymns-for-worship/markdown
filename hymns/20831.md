# 20831 - HE'S RISEN

## Notation

D - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Night is over; The morning breaks. The Sun has risen on this first day, Just like the morning when Mary cried, "He's risen! I've seen Him The crucified!"

### Verse 2

Night is over, How bright the day! That dares to step inside the grave And shout to all, "Awake and see: He's risen! Christ Jesus of Calvary!"

### Verse 3

Night is over; To lift the veil where death once lay. Unsealed our hearts; we, too, would sing: "He's risen! My Savior! My Lord! My King!"
