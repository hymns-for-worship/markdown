## Lyrics

### Verse 1

This is my Father's world, and to my listning ears, all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres. This is my Father's world, I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees of skies and seas  His hand a wondrous wrought.

### Verse 2

This is my Father's world, the birds their carol's raise, the morning light, the lily white, declare their Maker's praise. This is my Father's world, He shines in all that's fair; in the rustling grass I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere.

### Verse 3

This is my Father's world, o let me ne'er forget that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet. This is my Father's world, in battle we must trod; Jesus who died shall be satisfied, the kingdom turns back to God.

### Coda

Amen.
