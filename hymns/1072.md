# 1072 - Hilltops Of Glory

## Notation

Db - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Onward rejoicing I tread life's way, Higher I'm climbing each passing day; Hilltops of Glory now rise in view, where all shall be made new.

### Verse 2

Way down in Egypt mid burning sand, Moses has started for Canaan's land; Never turn backward always ascend on to the journey's end.

### Verse 3

Footsteps of Jesus before us lead, We tread life's journey, His warnings heed; Evil allurements cannot prevail, I'm on the upward trail.

### Chorus

Hilltops of glory I now can see. O brother won't you come go with me? Safe on the mountain I soon shall stand Hilltops of glory land.
