# 486 - What Shall It Profit

## Notation

Bb - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Not all earth's gold and silver Can make a sinner whole; What shall it profit thee, O man, If thou should'st lose thy soul?

### Verse 2

 The heaping up of riches To many seems life's goal; But in the eager rush for wealth, Forgotten is the soul.

### Verse 3

 This solemn question answer; Is worldly gain thy goal? Can fleeting riches be compared To an immortal soul? 

### Chorus

What shall it profit a man, What shall it profit a man, If he gain the whole world, And lose his own soul?
