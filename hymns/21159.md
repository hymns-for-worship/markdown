## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus has a table spread Where the saints of God are fed, He invites His chosen people, "Come and dine;" With His manna He doth feed And supplies our ev'ry need: O 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

### Verse 2

The disciples came to land, Thus obeying Christ's command, For the Master called unto them, "Come and dine;" There they found their hearts' desire, Bread and fish upon the fire: Thus He satisfies the hungry ev'ry time.

### Verse 3

Soon the Lamb will take His bride To be ever at His side, All the host of heaven will assembled be; O 'twill be a glorious sight, All the saints in spotless white, And with Jesus they will feast eternally.

### Chorus

"Come and dine," the Master calleth, "Come and dine;" You may feast at Jesus' table all the time. He who fed the multitude, Turned the water into wine, To the hungry calleth now, "Come and dine."
