## Notation

Ab - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Savior, more than life to me, I am clinging, clinging close to Thee; Let Thy precious blood applied, Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

### Verse 2

Thru this changing world below, Lead me gently, gently as I go; Trusting Thee, I cannot stray, I can never, never lose my way.

### Verse 3

Let me love Thee more and more, Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er; Till my soul is lost in love, In a brighter, brighter world above.

### Chorus

Ev'ry day,  ev'ry hour, Let me feel Thy cleansing pow'r, May Thy tender love to me, Bind me closer, closer Lord, to Thee.
