# 20391 - PEOPLE NEED THE LORD

## Notation

D - 4/4 on 2 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ev'ry day they pass me by, I can see it in their eyes Empty people filled with care headed for who knows where; On they go thru private pain, Living fear to fear, Laughter hides the silent cries Only Jesus hears.

### Verse 2

We are called to take His light To a world where wrong seems right, What could be too great a cost sharing life with one who's lost? Thru His love our hearts can feel All the grief they bear, They must hear the words of life Only we can share.

### Chorus

People need the lord, At the end of broken dreams He's the open door.
