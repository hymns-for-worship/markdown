## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Sing me a song about Jesus, Sing me a song about His love, Sing with all your might, ev'ry day and night, Make the hallelujahs roll; Sing out the blessed old story, Tell how He gave the victory, Dying on a tree, all for you and me, How He came and made me whole.

### Verse 2

 Jesus the wonderful Savior, Guides me along the rugged way, Never lets me fall, hears my feeble call, Makes the way so bright for me; I will forever adore Him, I will forever sing His praise, He will take me home, never more to roam, Then His loving face I'll see.

### Chorus

Sing me a song about Jesus, Sing me a song about His love, Sing with all your might ev'ry day and night, About Jesus, About His love, Sing it, sing it, If the way is bright or dim;
