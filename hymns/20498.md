Blue skies and rainbows and sunbeams from heaven are what I can see when  my Lord is living in me.

Green grass and flowers all blooming in springtime are works of the Master I live for each day.

### Verse 3

Tall mountains, green valleys the beauty that surrounds me all make me aware of the One who made it all.
