## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, Where the flow'rs are blooming and the sweet waters flow; Ev'rywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on, Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

### Verse 2

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow; With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear, Dangers cannot fright me, if my Lord is near.

### Verse 3

Down in the valley or upon the mountain steep, Close beside the Savior would my soul ever keep; He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod, Up to where they gather on the hills of God.

### Chorus

Follow, follow, I will follow Jesus! Anywhere, ev'rywhere, I will follow on; Follow, follow, I will follow Jesus! Ev'rywhere He leads me I will follow on.
