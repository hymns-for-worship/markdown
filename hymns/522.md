## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more, And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair; When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore, 

### Verse 2

 On that bright and glorious morning when the dead in Christ shall rise, And the glory of His resurrection share; When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies, 

### Verse 3

 Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun, Let us talk of all His wond'rous love and care; Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done,

### Chorus

When the roll is called up yonder, When he roll is called up yonder, When the roll is called up yonder, When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
