## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, scatter seeds of loving deeds, Along the fertile field; For grain will grow from what you sow, And fruitful harvest yield.

### Verse 2

Tho' sown in tears thur weary years, The seed will surely live; Tho' great the cost it is not lost, For God will fruitage give.



### Verse 3

The harvesthome of God will come, And after toil and care; With joy untold your sheaves of gold, Will all be garnered there.

### Chorus

 The seeds of promise cast; That ripened grain from hill and plain, Be gathered home at last.
