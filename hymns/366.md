# 366 - Rescue The Perishing

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying, Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; Weep o'er the erring one, Lift up the fallen, Tell them of Jesus the Mighty to save. 

### Verse 2

 Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter, Feelings lie buried that grace can restore; Touched by a loving heart, Wakened by kindness, Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.  

### Verse 3

 Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it; Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide; Back to the narrow way Patiently win them; Tell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died. 

### Chorus

Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying; Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
