## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The mighty God, Omniscient One! His ways we cannot trace. He reckons ev'ry good begun And crowns it with His grace.

### Verse 2

Lo! I can see Him in His word: I will not doubt or fear; My steps are ordered of the Lord, His guiding hand is near.

### Verse 3

No trial can my spirit break, For God will not forsake; He will with each temptation make A way for my escape.

### Verse 4

The future beckons and I bow: My God removes the care! Behold, He goes before me now, And will my way prepare.

### Chorus

He's here and there, and ev'rywhere In all the ways I've trod. I've never passed beyond the sphere Of the providence of God.
