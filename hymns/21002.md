## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On the happy golden shore, Where the faithful part no more, When the storms of life are o'er, Meet me there; Where the night dissolves away Into pure and perfect day, I am going home to stay Meet me there.

### Verse 2

Here our fondest hopes are vain, Dearest links are rent in twain, But in Heav'n no throb of pain Meet me there; By the river sparkling bright In the city of delight, Where our faith is lost in sight, Meet me there.

### Verse 3

Where the harps of angels ring, And the blest forever sing, In the palace of the King, Meet me there; Where in sweet communion blend Heart with heart and friend with friend, In a world that ne'er shall end, Meet me there.

### Chorus

Meet me there, meet me there, Where the tree of life is blooming, Meet me there; When the storms of life are o'er, On the happy, golden shore, Where the faithful part no more, Meet me there.
