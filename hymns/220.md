## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the land of fadeless day lies the city foursquare, it shall never pass away and there is no night there.

### Verse 2

All the gates with pearl are made in the city foursquare, and the street with gold is laid, and there is no night there.

### Verse 3

There they need no sunshine bright in that city foursquare, for the lamb is all the light, and there is no night there.

### Chorus

God shall wipe away all tears; there's no death, no pain, nor fears; and they count not time by years, for there is no night there.
