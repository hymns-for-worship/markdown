## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Heavenly love was all that could help me, I was astray, so sad and alone; I looked above, my burdens all left me, Now I can say, "Heaven's my home."

### Verse 2

Troubles of earth so often o'er take me, Burdens of life with heartache and care; Heavenly love will never forsake me, Filling my need, Jesus is there.

### Verse 3

When I shall stand at Jordan's dark river, Shadows of night are gath'ring above; There is a pow'r I know will deliver, Heavenly love, heavenly love.

### Chorus

Heavenly love, the love of my Lord, Lifting above for He is my sword and shield; Giving me light in darkness of night, Heavenly love, Heavenly love.
