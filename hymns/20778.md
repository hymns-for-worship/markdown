## Lyrics

### Verse 1

After I leave for worlds unknown, Over the border line; Never again on earth to roam, What will I leave behind.

### Verse 2

Will I be missed by those I love, Or have I been unkind? Have I been true to God above, What will I leave behind?

### Verse 3

This is my prayer, O Lord, today, Let me be wholly Thine; When I am called from earth away, Let heaven then be mine.

### Chorus

Leave behind, yes, leave behind, After I leave for worlds uknown, What will I leave behind?
