## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father, love me in my weakness and despair, When I feel unlovable and filled with care. When my selfishness o'erwhelms me and I cannot find my way, Father, love me, Father, love me.

### Verse 2

Lord, forgive me when in sin I find my soul. Help me turn my eyes to Calvary and its goal. Give me strength to find forgiveness and to face a brand new day. Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me.

### Verse 3

Father, save me when my eyes grow dim with time, With my body's strength no longer in its prime. Father, clothe me in that new form, bring me home to ever stay. Father, save me, Father, save me.
