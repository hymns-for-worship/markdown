## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've heard of a land of joy and peace and wonderful light, A beautiful place of mansions fair and skies ever bright, Where all who obey the Savior dear, forever shall stay And having been saved by grace divine, I'm going that way. And having been saved by grace divine, I'm going that way.

### Verse 2

The glorious news I tell and sing, as onward I go, That those who are still astray in sin my Savior may know, I want them to sing His praise above some beautiful day. For glory to Him who died for me, I'm going that way.

### Verse 3

I know I shall  meet Him at the gate, when trials are past, I know I shall meet Him face to face in glory at last, And, O, I believe that when we meet, "Well done," He will say. For trusting His soul redeeming love, I'm going that way.

### Chorus

I'm going that way, I'm going that way, And Jesus the Savior I adore is with me each day; I'm clinging to Him, and never to stray. Yes, singing His praises all day long. I'm going that way.
