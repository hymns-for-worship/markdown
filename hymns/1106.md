## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Monarch most high, Your Majesty! Thy children sing a psalm to Thee; And oft in prayer to Thee we go. Would Thee, O God, thy children know?

### Verse 2

Be with us, Lord, when trials assail, That almost make our hearts to fail. Be near, O Lord, nor far away. Be near and hear us when we pray.

### Verse 3

For every ill we seek Thy love. The sweetest balm is from above. When trials of life sweep o'er our souls, We pray and feel Thy grace unfold.

### Chorus

From high up there look down again. Thy grace is balm for every pain. Look down again. Let joys abound. Let gladness bloom. Let love be found.
