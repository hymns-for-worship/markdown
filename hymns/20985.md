## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I look toward the sky, then I know that He is nigh, All the beauty that I see is made by Him. As I look at what He's done, I know He is the One, the only God, our Father above.

### Verse 2

When I see the trees so tall, or the showers as they fall, As I watch the sunset hide behind the hill, Then my heart is filled with love; For my Father above, He made the world so lovely for me. 

### Verse 3

As I watch a bird in flight, or see twinkling stars at night, When I feel a gentle breeze upon my face, I've no doubt that He's the One from Whom blessings come, Almighty God, our Father and King.

### Chorus

There is one God, He created all things, He made our world so beautiful. How can some look at what He's done, and say He is not the One? He is our God, the only God in heaven above.
