# 092.15 - Others

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, help me live from day to day a selfforgetful way that even when I kneel to pray my prayer shall be for others.

### Verse 2

Help me in all the work I do to ever be sincere and true, and know that all I do for you must needs be done for others.

### Verse 3

Let "self" be crucified and slain and buried deep: and all in vain may efforts be to rise again, unless to live for others.

### Verse 4

And when my work on earth is done, and my new work in heav'ns begun, may I forget the crown I've won while thinking still of others.

### Chorus

Others, Lord, yes, others, let this my motive be, help me to live for others, that I may live like Thee.
