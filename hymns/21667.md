## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing, Bid us all depart in peace; Let us each Thy love possessing, Triumph in redeeming grace. 



### Verse 2

Fill each breast with consolation, Up to Thee our voices raise; When we reach that blissful station, Then we'll give Thee nobler praise. 



### Verse 3

Thanks we give and adoration For the gospel's joyful sound; May the fruits of thy salvation In our hearts and lives abound. 



### Verse 4

Then whene'er the signal's given, Us from earth to call away, Borne on angel's wings to heaven, We the summons will obey. 

### Coda

Hallelujah!
