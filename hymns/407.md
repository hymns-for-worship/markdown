## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 He leadeth me! O blessed tho't! O words with heav'nly comfort fraught! Whate'er I do, wheree'er I be, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

### Verse 2

 Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom, Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom, By waters still, o'er troubled sea, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

### Verse 3

 And when my task on earth is done, When by God's grace, the vict'ry's won, E'en death's cold wave I will not flee, Since God thru Jordan leadeth me.

### Chorus

He leadeth me, He leadeth me, By His own hand He leadeth me: His faithful follow'r I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.
