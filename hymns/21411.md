# 21411 - REND YOUR HEART

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rend your heart and not your garments. Shed your sin and not your tears. Weep and wail in soul and spirit, Not in show for all to hear. For the Lord is slow to anger, Full of pity, full of grace, Bringing near the brokenhearted, They shall look upon His face.

### Verse 2

Dress in sorrow, not in sackcloth. With remorse, not dust, be crowned. Sit in shame before your Master, Not in ashes on the ground. For the Lord abounds in mercy, Giving grace to those in shame, And He clothes them with salvation When they call upon His name.
