## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Upon a darkened hilltop, the Savior suffered shame, As sinner mocked the Sinless and ridiculed His name. They kill the very Jesus who bore their ev'ry care, Accusing and reviling, they stood and watched Him there.

### Verse 2

The Father who had sent Him, forsook Him on a tree, And gave His only Offspring to set all captives free. Now burdened with a sorrow that no one else could share, He heard His Son cry "Father!" How could He watch Him there?

### Verse 3

Disciples who had loved Him were distant from that place, And some who swore allegiance felt shame and hid their face. Confused by what He told them, they struggled in despair; So far off in the distance, they stood and watched Him there.

### Verse 4

His grace I cannot fathom; yet I hold fast His love, Though I am not deserving of mercy from above. I cry for pain He suffered; His grief I cannot bear. I weep in pray'rful silence; I bow and watch Him there.
