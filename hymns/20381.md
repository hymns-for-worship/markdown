## Lyrics

### Verse 1

This life is like a vapor spread 'fore eternity, Where we must stand before the throne across the stormy sea. We'll stand before the throne of God, on that great judgement day, Then He will choose the golden grain and cast the rest away.

### Verse 2

### Verse 3

O, God forbid that we should shun our blessed Savior's face. And live such lives upon the earth to reach that awful place. But Lord and Savior guide our steps in this vile world of pain. So when we're called upon to die, we'll be the golden grain.

O, can we be that golden grain that beautiful golden grain, When God sees fit to call
