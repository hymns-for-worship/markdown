## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, when I think of how He came so far from glory, Came and dwelt among the lowly such as I. To suffer shame and such disgrace  On Mount Calv'ry take my place;  Then I ask myself this question,  Who am I? 

### Verse 2

When I'm reminded of His words, "I'll leave you never,  If you're true, I'll give you life forever." And O, I wonder what I've have done To deserve God's only Son Fights fight my battles until til they're won. Who who am I? 

### Chorus

Who am I, that a king would bleed and die for? Who am I that He would pray:  "Not my will but, Thine, Lord"? The answer I may never know, The answer I may never know, Why He ever loved me so. But to an old rugged cross He'd go, For who am I?
