## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Soon the toils of life shall cease, then no sorrow we shall know, in that home of the soul; there we'll dwell in joy and peace, robed in garments white as snow, in that home of the soul.

### Verse 2

There the savior we shall see, and His glory ever share, in that home of the soul; reunited we shall be, with the ransomed over there, in that home of the soul.

### Verse 3

While the ages onward role, round the shining  throne we'll sing, in that home of the soul; with the angels we'll extoll, Christ who was our Lord, and King, in that home of the soul.

### Chorus

Blessed thought, there to dwell, in that home of the soul; endless praise we shall swell, in that home of the soul.
