## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Life is full of trials, and great temptations. We can call on God to help us through. We're all His children, He loves so much. We can count on Him; Can He count on us?

### Verse 2

Lift up the fallen from great destruction, That they might see their erring ways. Help them be learning God's holy word, That directs them up To heaven above.

### Verse 3

Parents love your children As our God loves you. That they may have a happy home. Teach them to have faith that is unfeigned, That will lead them through God's heavenly gate.

### Verse 4

We know not the  hour when God will call us. Let us all prepare to meet our fate. We pray that some day God says these word: "Well done, My child, You've won a great fight."
