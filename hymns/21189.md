## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My soul, be on thy guard; Ten thousand foes arise; The hosts of sin are pressing hard To draw thee from the skies.

### Verse 2

O watch, and fight, and pray; The battle ne'er give o'er; Renew it boldly evâ€˜ry day, And help divine implore.

### Verse 3

Ne'er think the vict'ry won, Nor lay thine armor down; The work of faith will not be done Till thou obtain the crown.

### Verse 4

Fight on, my soul, till death Shall bring thee to thy God; He'll take thee, at thy parting breath, To His divine abode.
