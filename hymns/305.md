### Verse 1

There's a stranger at the door, Let him in, he has been there oft before, Let him in; Let him in ere he is gone, Let him in the holy one; Jsus christ the father's son, Let him in. Let the Savior in.

### Verse 2

Open now to him your heart; Let him in, if you wait he will depart; Let him in, Let him in, he is your friend, he your soul will sure defend, he will keep you to the end, Let him in. Let the Savior in.

### Verse 3

Hear you now his loving voice? Let him in, now, O now make him your choice, Let him in, he is standing at your door, joy to you he will restore, and his name you will adore, Let him in. Let the Savior in.
