## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 How I praise Thee, precious Savior, That Thy love laid hold of me; Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me That I might Thy channel be.

### Verse 2

 Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me, A clean vessel in Thy hand; With no pow'r but as Thou givest Graciously with each command.

### Verse 3

 Witnessing Thy pow'r to save me, Setting free from self and sin; Thou who bought me to possess me, In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

### Verse 4

 Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit Hearts that full surrender know; That the streams of living water From our inner man may flow.

### Chorus

Channels only, blessed Master, But with all Thy wondrous pow'r, Flowing through us, Thou canst use us Ev'ry day and ev'ry hour.
