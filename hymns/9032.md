## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Monarch most high, Your Majesty! Thy children sing a psalm to Thee; And oft in prayer to Thee we go, Would Thee, O God, They children know.

### Verse 2

Be with us Lord, when trials assail, That almost make our hearts to fail. Be near, O Lord, nor far away. E near and hear us when we pray.

### Verse 3

For ev'ry ill we seek Thy love. The sweetest balm is from a bove. When trials of life sweep o'er or souls, We pray and feel They grace unfold.

### Chorus

From high up there look down again. They grace is balm for every pain. Look down again. Let joys abound. Let gladness bloom, Let love be found.
