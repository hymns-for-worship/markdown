## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who is this in silence bending Over this dark burial cave. Sympathetic sorrow blending With the tears around that grave? Christ the Lord is standing by, At the tomb of Bethany.

### Verse 2

Jesus wept! Those tears are over, But His heart is still the same; Kinsman, Friend, and elder Brother Is His everlasting name. Savior, who can love like You, Gracious one of Bethany?

### Verse 3

When the pangs of trial seize us, When the waves of sorrow roll, I will lay my head on Jesus, Refuge of the troubled soul. Surely, none can feel like You, Weeping one of Bethany!

### Verse 4

Jesus wept! and still in glory He can mark each mourner's tear, Loving to retrace the story Of the hearts He solaced here. Lord, when I am called to die, Let me think of Bethany.

### Verse 5

Jesus wept! That tear of sorrow Is a legacy of love; Yesterday, today, tomorrow, He the same does ever prove. You are all in all to me, Living One of Bethany!
