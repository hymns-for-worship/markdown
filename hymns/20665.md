# 20665 - WE ASK GOD

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 3+ - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We ask the Lord for all that we receive, He gives each dawn and hunger He relieves. God gives us strength to carry on each day. He heals the sick and guards us on our way.

### Verse 2

We ask the Lord for patience to endure. Thru trials hard our hope He does assure. God sends His Light, His wisdom and His Love; They guide our steps to end in realms above.

### Verse 3

Do we return our gratitude and praise For blessings sent to ease our earthly days? Do we ask God in bold sincerity To guide our steps into eternity?
