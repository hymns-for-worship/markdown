## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I want to be a soldier for Jesus; I want to carry His banner far and wide. I will do battle against Satan's army And gain the vict'ry with Jesus by my side. I'll carry with me God's sword of the Spirit; Salvation's helmet will be upon my head. I'll firmly hold the shield of faith before me And follow Je-sus whereever I am led.

### Verse 2

I want to be a worker for Jesus; I want to labor in harvest fields of white. I will be steadfast and toil in God's vineyard, Gathering sweet souls with Jesus by my side. I will sow seeds of true and simple Gospel to fall upon hearts of honest, searching souls. They will be nourished with the Living Water; God gives the increase and watches as they grow.

### Verse 3

I want to be a servant for Jesus; I want to humble myself with no more pride, I will do good deeds and pure acts of kindness While serving others with Jesus by my side. If just a cup of cool refreshing water Is all that I have to give my fellow man, Then let me see no one is ever thirsty. With what I have I will do the most I can.
