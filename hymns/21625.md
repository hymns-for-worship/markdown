## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hungry, and faint, and poor, Behold us, Lord, again Assembled at Thy mercy's door, Thy bounty to obtain.



### Verse 2

Thy word invites us nigh, Or we would starve indeed; For we no money have to buy, Nor righteousness to plead.



### Verse 3

The food our spirits want, Thy hand alone can give; O hear the pray'r of faith, and grant That we may eat and live!



### Verse 4

Here, by the fount we stay, Here eat this bread of Thine; Then go rejoicing on our way, Renewed with strength divine.
