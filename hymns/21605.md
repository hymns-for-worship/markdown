## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a river glorious Is God's perfect peace, Over all victorious In its bright increase; Perfect, yet it floweth Fuller ev'ry day; Perfect, yet it groweth Deeper all the way.



### Verse 2

Hidden in the hollow Of His blessed hand, Never foe can follow, Never traitor stand; Not a surge of worry, Not a shade of care, Not a blast of hurry Touch the spirit there. 


### Verse 3

Ev'ry joy or trial Falleth from above, Traced upon our dial By the Sun of Love; We may trust Him fully All for us to do; They who trust Him wholly Find Him wholly true.


### Chorus

Stayed upon Jehovah, Hearts are fully blessed; Finding, as He promised, Perfect peace and rest.
