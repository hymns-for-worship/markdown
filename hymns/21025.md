## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just when I need Him, Jesus is near, Just when I falter, just when I fear; Ready to help me, ready to cheer, Just when I need Him most.

### Verse 2

Just when I need Him, Jesus is true, Never forsaking, all the way thru; Giving for burdens pleasures anew, Just when I need Him most.

### Verse 3

Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong, Bearing my burdens all the day long; For all my sorrow giving a song, Just when I need Him most.

### Verse 4

Just when I need Him, He is my all, Answering when upon Him I call; Tenderly watching lest I should fall, Just when I need Him most.

### Chorus

Just when I need Him most, Just when I need Him most, Jesus is near to comfort and cheer, Just when I need Him most.
