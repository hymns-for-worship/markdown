### Verse 1

All praise to Thee, my God, this night, For all the blessings of the light: Keep me, O keep me, King of kings, Beneath Thine own almighty wings.

### Verse 2

Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son, The ill that I this day have done; That with the world, myself, and Thee, I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

### Verse 3

O may my soul on Thee repose, And with sweet sleep my eyelids close; Sleep that shall me more vig'rous make To serve my God when I awake.

### Verse 4

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; Praise Him, all creatures here below; Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host; Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
