## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I need the prayers of those who love me, I need the prayers of those who care; I need the help of every christian, to take God's message everywhere.

### Verse 2

I cannot walk the stright and narrow, without my Savior's guiding hand; He'll light the way and make it fairer, for all the faithful in the land.

### Verse 3

He'll hold your hand when you are dying, give strength to cross the Jordan wide; He'll help you answer at the judgement, if in His love you will abide.

### Chorus

He answers prayer for all the faithful, He holds the future in His hand; He'll guide us safely over Jordan, our heavenly Father understands, understands.
