O God, let people praise Thee; Let all the people sing. Let nations now be joyful; Let songs of gladness ring. O hear me now, Jehovah, Be gracious unto me. To You I cry, Jehovah, O now my helper be! O God, to us show mercy; And bless us in Thy grace. Cause Thou to shine upon us The brightness of Thy face. In glory I will praise Thee, and never silent be. O Lord, my God, I'll thank Thee thru all eternity! O hear me now, Jehovah, Be gracious unto me In glory I will praise Thee, and never silent be.
