# 560 - More Like The Master

## Notation

Db - 6/8 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Â More like the Master I would ever be, More of His meekness, more humility; More zeal to labor, more courage to be true, More consecration for work He bids me do.

### Verse 2

More like the Master is my daily prayer; More strength to carry crosses I must bear; More earnest effort His kingdom to increase, More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.

### Verse 3

More like the Master I would live and grow; More of His love to others I would show; More selfdenial, like His in Galilee, More like the Master I long to ever be. 

### Chorus

Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone, Take Thou my heart and make it all Thine own; Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore, Wash me and keep me Thine forever more.
