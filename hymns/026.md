## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts, Thou fount of life, Thou light of men, from all the bliss that earth imparts we turn unfilled to Thee again.

### Verse 2

Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; Thou savest those that on Thee call;  to them that seek Thee Thou art good; to them that find Thee, all in all.

### Verse 3

On Thee we feed, Thou living bread, and long to feast upon Thee still; we drink of Thee, Thou fountainhead, whose streams each thirsting soul can fill.

### Verse 4

On Jesus, ever with us stay, make all our moments calm and bright; chase the dark night of sin away, shed o'er the world Thy holy light.
