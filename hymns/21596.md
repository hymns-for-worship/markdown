## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned Upon the Savior's brow; His head with radiant glories crowned, His lips with grace o'erflow. His lips with grace o'erflow.



### Verse 2

No mortal can with Him compare Among the sons of men; Fairer is He than all the fair Who fill the heav'nly train. Who fill the heav'nly train.



### Verse 3

He saw me plunged in deep distress, And flew to my relief; For me He bore the shameful cross, And carried all my grief. And carried all my grief.



### Verse 4

To Him I owe my life and breath, And all the joys I have; He makes me triumph over death, And saves me from the grave. And saves me from the grave.


### Verse 5

Since from Thy bounty I receive Such proofs of love divine, Had I a thousand hearts to give, Lord they should all be Thine. Lord they should all be Thine.
