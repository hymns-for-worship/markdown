## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Standing on the promises of Christ my King, Thru eternal ages let His praises ring; Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing, 

### Verse 2

 Standing on the promises that cannot fail, When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, By the living word of God I shall prevail,

### Verse 3

 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord, Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword, 

### Chorus

Standing on the promises of God. Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of God my Savior; Standing, standing, I'm standing on the promises of God.
