### Verse 1

If you are tired of the load of your sin, Let Jesus come into your heart; If you desire a new life to begin, Let Jesus come into your heart.



### Verse 2

If 'tis for purity now that you sigh, Let Jesus come into your heart; Fountains for cleansing are flowing nearby, Let Jesus come into your heart.

### Verse 3

If there's a tempest your voice cannot still, Let Jesus come into your heart; If there's a void this world never can fill, Let Jesus come into your heart.



### Verse 4

If you would join the glad songs of the blest, Let Jesus come into your heart; If you would enter the mansions of rest, Let Jesus come into your heart.

### Chorus

Just now your doubtings give o'er, Just now reject Him no more; Just now throw open the door; Let Jesus come into your heart.
