## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My God and I, against all the world, fighting temptation, evil, and sin. Using the armor He has prepared, zealous for battle, ever to win.

### Verse 2

My God and I, together we fight, clashing with men, with sin they pursue. He will not fail me where e'er I go, He will be with me, constant and true.

### Chorus

With His help, I will be radiant in holiness. I will be loyal with faithfulness. I will be zealous in righteousness. Filled with His Spirit, wisdom and might! We win the battle, we win the fight! My God, and I, my God and I.
