# 20647 - THE CHURCH OF GOD

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God's family is His church divine, Begun, sustained, by His wise design; The ark of age and the shrine of youth! From her alone goes the word of truth.

### Verse 2

Beyond are those who have conquered death; Below are they who abide in faith, The twain, yon host and the saints of earth One household are by a holy birth.

### Verse 3

What glory there! O what blessings here One hope, one Lord and His name to wear! One church, one creed, meeting ev'ry need All nations blest by His righteous seed.

### Chorus

The church of God is the bride of Christ Redeemed by His blood what a purchase price! The kingdom of God and saints' abode; The realm of life for the sons of God.
