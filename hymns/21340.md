## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It is good to sing Your praises And to thank You, O Most High, Showing forth Your lovingkindness When the morning lights the sky. It is good when night is falling Of Your faithfulness to tell, While with sweet, melodious praises Songs of adoration swell.

### Verse 2

You have filled my heart with gladness Thru the works Your hands have wrought; You have made my life victorious, Great Your works and deep Your thought. You, O LORD, on high exalted, Reigning evermore in might, All Your enemies shall perish, Sin be banished from Your sight.

### Verse 3

But the good shall live before You, Planted in Your dwelling place, Fruited trees and ever verdant, Nourished by Your boundless grace. In His goodness to the righteous God His righteousness displays; God, my Rock, my Strength, my Refuge, Just and true are all Your ways.
