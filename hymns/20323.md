### Verse 1

A blessing so grand from our God unto man, So that we may be granted a child. Such a glorious plan You have given to man; Bring-ing love that's so wondrously mild.

### Verse 2

A blessing so grand from our God unto man, So that we may be granted a child. Such a glorious plan You have given to man; Bringing love that's so wondrously mild.

### Verse 3

The gift of our children won't last here for e'er; But entrusted to us for our care care. Yes, to keep and to mold and to hold for awhile, What great blessings Jehovah doth share. 

### Verse 4

We'll mind how we mold; let Your will take control; Precious children allowed to our trust. They belong  unto You, Holy Father above, And  You now only share  them with us.
