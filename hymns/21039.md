## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Is your life a channel of blessing? Is the love of God flowing thru you? Are you telling the lost of the Savior? Are you ready His service to do?

### Verse 2

Is your life a channel of blessing? Are you burdened for those that are lost? Have you urged upon those who are straying The Savior who died on the cross?

### Verse 3

Is your life a channel of blessing? Is it daily telling for Him? Have you spoken the word of salvation To those who are dying in sin? 

### Verse 4

We cannot be channels of blessing If our lives are not free from all sin, We will barriers be and a hindrance To those we are trying to win.

### Chorus

Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of blessing today.
