## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I know (I know) that my Redeemer lives, And ever prays and ever prays for me; I know I know eternal life He gives, from sin and sorrow free.

### Verse 2

 He wills (He wills) that I should holy be, In word, in tho't, (in word, in tho't,) in deed; Then I (then I) His holy face may see, When from this earth life freed.

### Verse 3

 I know (I know) that unto sinful men His saving grace (His saving grace) is nigh; I know (I know) that He will come again To take me home on high.

### Verse 4

 I know (I know) that over yonder stands A place prepared (a place prepared) for me; A home, (a home,) a house not made with hands, Most won-der-ful to see.

### Chorus

I know, I know that my Redeemer lives, I know, I know eternal life He gives; I know, I know that my Redeemer lives.
