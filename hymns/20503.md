## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Last night when I was lonely, I looked up at the sky. The stars looked like notes in the air; Like a mighty piece of music penned by God's own hand, Written for a choir way up there. I heard the angels sing, Glory hallelujah! A mighty chorus way up high; I heard the angels sing, "Praise the name of Jesus!" Singing in God's choir in the sky. I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His glory, Telling the story: How He came to earth to die; I heard a million voices praise the name of esus, Singing in God's choir in the sky.

### Verse 2

I heard the glorious song coming out of Heaven, The sweetest music ever heard; I heard a mighty song sung by all the angels, My soul thrilled at ev'ry loving word. I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His glory, Telling the story: How He came to earth to die; I heard a million voices praise the name of esus, Singing in God's choir in the sky.

### Verse 3

I fell down on my knees when that chorus ended, They shouted out a glad "Amen!" I fell down on my knees, prayed that when in Heaven, I would hear that choir once again. I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His glory, Telling the story: How He came to earth to die; I heard a million voices praise the name of esus, Singing in God's choir in the sky.
