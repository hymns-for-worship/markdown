## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dread not the things that are ahead, The burdens great, the sinking sands, The thorns that o'er that path are spread, God holds the future in His hands.

### Verse 2

We know not what tomorrow hides, Of sun or storm, of good or ill; We only know His dear hand guides, And He will be our Father still.

### Verse 3

His hand created earth and sky, The zephyrs and the storms that rage, And years to come and years gone by To Him are but an open page.

### Verse 4

Live close to Him and trust His love, Assured that while on earth we roam, Whate'er may come, He bends above To guide His children safely home.

### Chorus

God holds the future in His hands, And ev'ry heart He understands; On Him depend; He is your Friend; He holds the future in His hands.
