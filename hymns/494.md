## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Lead on, O King Eternal, The day of march has come; Henceforth in fields of conquest Thy tents shall be our home; Thru days of preparation Thy grace has made us strong, And now, O King Eternal, We lift our battle song.

### Verse 2

 Lead on, O King Eternal, Till sin's fierce war shall cease, And holiness shall whisper The sweet Amen of peace; For not with swords loud clashing, Nor roll of stirring drums: With deeds of love and mercy, The heav'nly kingdom comes.

### Verse 3

 Lead on, O King Eternal, We follow, not with fears; For gladness breaks like morning Where'er Thy face appears; Thy cross is lifted o'er us: We journey in its light; The crown awaits the conquest: Lead on, O God of might!
