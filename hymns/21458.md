## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I think of troubles in the past, When I wonder if my faith will last, When the sky is dark and overcast, Quiet Thou my soul, O Lord.

### Verse 2

All around my feet is sinking sand, Although on solid rock I stand. Is this the life my Father planned? Quiet Thou my soul, O Lord.

### Verse 3

The future lies ahead, unknown, As I travel t'ward my heav'nly home. Will I stand the test, whatever come? Quiet Thou my soul, O Lord.

### Chorus

Quiet Thou my soul within me, Lord, Let me find sweet rest within Thy Word, Till my troubled spirit has been restored, Quiet Thou my soul, O Lord.
