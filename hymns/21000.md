## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Surrounded by those who have traveled this road, We throw off the heavy and hindering load. The sin that entangles we lay it aside, And run with our eyes on the One crucified. Consider Him, who endured such opposition from sinful men. Consider Him, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. Consider Him, consider Him.

### Verse 2

The Author and Perfecter of our faith paid the cost, For the joy set before Him He suffered the cross. Scorning its shame He sat down by the throne, And smiled as He watched His lost children come home. Consider Him, who endured such opposition from sinful men. Consider Him, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. Consider Him, consider Him.
