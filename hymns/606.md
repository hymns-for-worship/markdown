## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Since I started for the Kingdom, Since my life He controls, Since I gave my heart to Jesus, The Jesus, The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows. 

### Verse 2

 Ev'ry need He is supplying, Plenteous grace He bestows; Ev'ry day my way gets brighter, The brighter, The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

### Chorus

The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows, The more that I love Him, more love He bestows; Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows, The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.
