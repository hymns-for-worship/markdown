## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When Jesus comes to reward his servants, faithful to him will he find us watching, with our lamps all trimmed and bright?

### Verse 2

If at the dawn of the early morning, he shall call us one by one, when to the lord we restore our talents, will he answer thee well done?

### Verse 3

Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching, in his glory they shall share; if he shall come at the dawn or midnight, will he find us watching there?

### Chorus

O can we say, we are ready, brother, ready for the souls bright home? Say, will he find yo uand me still watching, waiting, waiting when the lord shall come?
