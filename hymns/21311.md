## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let every language,  tribe and land, As countless as the stars and sand, Now join as one to praise our King, Let every saint bow down and sing: 

### Verse 2

At Babel, God chose to divide The languages of those in pride. But now, in Christ, those tongues unite Before the throne both day and night: 

### Verse 3

And so it is that Babel's curse, By Jesus' work, has been reversed. So let us bring all nations in To sing with all redeemed from sin: 

### Chorus

All blessing, glory, wisdom, might Be to our God who dwells in light; Thanksgiving, honor, pow'r to Him, And to the Lamb! Amen, amen.
