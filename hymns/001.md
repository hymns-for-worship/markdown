## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and Mighty! God ever all, and blest eternally.

### Verse 2

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee, Casting down their golden crowns around a glassy sea; Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee, Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.

### Verse 3

Holy, holy, holy! Tho' the darkness hide Thee, Tho' the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see, Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, Perfect in  pow'r, in love, and purity.

### Verse 4

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth, and sky, and sea; Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! God over all, and blest eternally.
