## Lyrics

### Verse 1

At the sounding of the trumpet, when the saints are gathered home, We will greet each other by the crystal sea, With the saints and all the saved ones there awaiting us to come, What a gath'ring of the faithful that will be!

### Verse 2

When the angel of the Lord proclaims earthtime shall be no more, We shall gather, and the saved and ransomed see, Then to meet again together, on the bright celestial shore, What a gath'ring of the faithful that will be!

### Verse 3

At the great and final judgment, when the hidden comes to light, When the Lord in all His glory we shall see; At the bidding of our Savior, "Come ye blessed, to My right," What a gath'ring of the faithful that will be!

### Verse 4

When the golden cords are sounding, and the angel bands proclaim, In triumphant strains the glorious jubilee; Then to meet and join to sing the song of Moses and the Lamb, What a gath'ring of the faithful that will be!

### Chorus

What a gath'ring, gath'ring, At the sounding of the glorious jubilee! What a gath'ring, gath'ring, What a gath'ring of the faithful that will be!
