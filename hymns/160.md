## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One day when heaven was filled with His praises, one day when sin was as black as could be, Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin dwealt among men, my example is He!

### Verse 2

One day they led Him up calvary's mountain, one day they nailed Him to die on the tree, suffering anguish, despised and rejected; bearing our sins, my redeemer is He!

### Verse 3

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, one day the stone rolled away from the door; then he arose, over death he had conquered; now is ascended my Lord evermore!

### Verse 4

One day the trumpet will sound for his coming, one day the skies with his glory will shine; wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing; glorious savior, this Jesus is mine!

### Chorus

Living, He loved me, dying He saved me, buried he carried my sins far away; rising he justified freely forever: one day He's coming, o glorious day!
