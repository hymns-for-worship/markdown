## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O magnify my Master, exalt His holy name. His name I praise forever, forever and again. To heights of all Thy glory, to heights beyond the sky; To far beyond creation; to Him let praises fly.

### Verse 2

With words of adoration, with songs of endless praise; From hearts that know but gladness, for love of heaven's ways, And from yon realms, majestic, where saints of ages gone; With joy my soul would cherish; praise Jesus all day long.

### Verse 3

As well as I may praise Thee in my own fragile way. Nor with my soul, O Jesus, could I Thy love repay. I sing of all Thy graces, I bow and laud Thy care, And take of all Thy blessings. I see them ev'rywhere.
