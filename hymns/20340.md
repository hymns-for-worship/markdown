# 20340 - LIVING BY FAITH

## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I care not today what the morrow may bring, If shadow or sunshine or rain, The Lord I know ruleth o'er everything, And all of my worry is vain.

### Verse 2

Tho' tempests may blow and the stormclouds arise, Obscuring the brightness of life, I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies, The Master looks on at the strife. 

### Verse 3

I know that He safely will carry me thru, No matter what evils betide, Why should I then care tho' the tempest may blow If Jesus walks close to my side. 

### Verse 4

Our Lord will return to this earth some sweet day, Our troubles will then all be o'er, The Master so gently will lead us away, Beyond that blest heavenly shore.  

### Chorus

Living by faith, in Jesus above Trusting, confiding in His great love; From all harm safe in His sheltering arm, I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.
