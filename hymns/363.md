## Notation

D - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, A wonderful Savior to me; He hideth my soul in the cleft of the Rock, Where rivers of pleasure I see. 

### Verse 2

 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, He taketh my burden away; He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved, He giveth me strength as my day. 

### Verse 3

 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise To meet Him in clouds of the sky; His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, I'll shout with the millions on high. 

### Chorus

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the Rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land; He hideth my life in the depth of His love, And covers me there with His hand, And covers me there with His hand.
