# 20843 - ARE YOU READY

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Soon the evening shadows falling, Close the day of mortal life; Soon the hand of death appalling, Draws thee from its weary strife. 

### Verse 2

Soon the awful trumpet sounding, Calls thee to the judgment throne; Now prepare, for love abounding Yet has left thee not alone.

### Verse 3

O, how fatal 'tis to linger! Are you ready, ready now; Ready, should death's icy finger Lay its chill upon thy brow?

### Verse 4

Priceless love and free salvation Freely still are offered thee; Yield no longer to temptation, But from sin and sorrow flee.

### Chorus

Are you ready? Are you ready? 'Tis the Spirit calling: why delay? Are you ready? Are you ready? Do not linger longer: Come today.
