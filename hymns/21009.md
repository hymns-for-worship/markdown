# 21009 - MY LIVING IS CHRIST

## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Buried with Christ, I have died to my sin; A new life now fills me where evil had been. Transferred from darkness to Heaven's domain, My living is Christ and my dying is gain.

### Verse 2

Living for Jesus, conformed to His cross, The pleasures of sin I am counting as loss. Dying each day unto all things profane, My living is Christ and my dying is gain.

### Verse 3

Living, my gladness is serving the Lord, And dying, His presence shall be my reward. Joyful and blest should I die or remain, My living is Christ and my dying is gain.
