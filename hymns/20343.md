## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Safely thru another week, God has bro't us on our way; Let us now a blessing seek, Wait-ing in His courts today: Day of all the week the best, Soon will come eternal rest; Day of all the week the best, Soon will come eternal rest.

### Verse 2

While we seek supplies of grace, Thru the dear Redeemer's name, Show thy reconciling face, Take away our sin and shame; From our worldly cares set free, May we rest this day in Thee; From our worldly cares set free, May we rest this day in Thee.

### Verse 3

Here we come Thy name to praise: May we feel Thy presence near; May Thy glory meet our eyes, While we in Thy house appear; Here afford us, Lord, a taste of our everlasting feast; Here afford us, Lord, a taste of our everlasting feast.

### Verse 4

May the gospel's joyful sound Conquer sinners, comfort saints; Make the fruits of grace abound, Bring relief to all complaints; Thus may all our worship prove, Till we join the church above; Thus may all our worship prove, Till we join the church above.
