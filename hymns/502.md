### Verse 1

 Truehearted, wholehearted, faithful and loyal, King of our lives, by Thy grace we will be; Under the standard exalted and royal, Strong in Thy strength we will battle for Thee.

### Verse 2

 Truehearted, wholehearted, fullest allegiance Yielding henceforth to our glorious King; Valiant endeavor and loving obedience, Freely and joyously now would we bring. 

### Verse 3

 Truehearted, wholehearted, Savior all glorious! Take Thy great power and reign there alone, Over our wills and affections victorious, Freely surrendered and wholly Thine own. 

### Chorus

Peal out the watchword! silence it never! Song of our spirits, rejoicing and free; Peal out the watchword! loyal forever, King of our lives, by Thy grace we will be.
