## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Above the earth and far away, God stationed two great lights, A greater light to rule the day, A lesser light the night. He set them high, and hour by hour, All men look up to see His unseen things: His endless pow'r, And His divinity.

### Verse 2

 Then shining down from God in heav'n; The greatest Light soon came; He burned into the heart of man And kindled there a flame. He said, 

### Verse 3

 O lesser lights, we shine not bright With glory of our own, But we reflect a greater Light: Bright glory from the Son! When men behold the lives we live, They see the Light above; And when they feel the warmth we give, They touch His greater love.
