## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Master has come, and He calls us to follow The track of the footprints He leaves on our way; Far over the mountain and thru the deep hollow, The path leads us on to the mansions of day; The Master has called us, the children who fear Him, Who march 'neath Christ's banner, His own little band; We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him, And rest in the light of His beautiful land.

### Verse 2

The Master has called us; the road may be dreary,  And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track; But God's Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary; We follow the Savior and cannot turn back.
The Master has called us; thoâ€™ doubt and temptation May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing: "Press onward, look upward," thru much tribulation; The children of Zion must follow their King.


### Verse 3

The Master has called us, in life's early morning, With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod; We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning To cast in our lot with the people of God: The Master has called us, His sons and His daughters, We plead for His blessing and trust in His love: And thru the green pastures, beside the still waters, He'll lead us at last to His kingdom above.
