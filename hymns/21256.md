## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be calm in thy soul, This world is not our goal, Lay up your treasure in that heav'nly home; When this life is o'er, We'll rest forevermore, Don't worry for tomorrow, Live in hope.

### Verse 2

Be calm in thy soul as years are growing old, The gospel gives you comfort on life's road; Remember each day to kneel down and to pray, Don't worry for tomorrow, Live in hope.

### Verse 3

Be calm in thy soul, Let Jesus make you whole, The Lord can ease your burdens and your woe; In Heaven some day, We'll put all pain away, Don't worry for tomorrow, Live in hope.
