## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 9 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I walk with the savior, each step of the way, I trust him to guide me by night and by day; not dreading tomorrow nor what it may bring, I'm safe in the keeping of Jesus my king.

### Verse 2

With joy we shall enter the city up there, of wonderful beauty and mansions all fair; his own shall be changed and made like him that day, because we've walked with him each step of the way.

### Chorus

Each step of the way, by night and by day, leads nearer the home, eternally fair, where we shall meet loved ones awaiting us there, who walked here with Jesus each step of the way.
