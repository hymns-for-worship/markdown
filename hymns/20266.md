## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O to see the dawn of the darkest day, Christ on the road to Calvary; Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten then Nailed to a cross of wood. This the pow'r of the cross: Christ became sin for us, Took the blame, bore the wrath; We stand forgiven at the cross. 

### Verse 2

O to see the pain written on Your face, Bearing the awesome weight of sin; Ev'ry bitter tho't, ev'ry evil deed Crowning Your bloodstained brow. This the pow'r of the cross: Christ became sin for us, Took the blame, bore the wrath; We stand forgiven at the cross. 

### Verse 3

Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath Quakes as its maker bows His head; Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life, "Finished!" the vict'ry cry. This the pow'r of the cross: Christ became sin for us, Took the blame, bore the wrath; We stand forgiven at the cross. 

### Verse 4

O to see my name written in the wounds, For thru Your suff'ring I am free; Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live, Won thru Your selfless love! This the pow'r of the cross:  Son of God slain for us; What a life, what a cost!  We stand forgiven at the cross.
