## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The strife is o'er, the battle done; The victory of life is won; The song of triumph has begun: Alleluia!

### Verse 2

The pow'rs of death have done their worst; But Christ their legions has dispersed; Let shouts of holy joy outburst: Alleluia!

### Verse 3

The three sad days are quickly sped; He rises glorious from the dead; All glory to our risen Head! Alleluia!

### Verse 4

He closed the yawning gates of hell; The bars from heav'n's high portals fell. Let hymns of praise His triumph tell. Alleluia!


### Verse 5

Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee, From death's dread sting Thy servants free, That we may live and sing to Thee. Alleluia!
