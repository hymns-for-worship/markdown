## Notation

Db - 6/4 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The world has lost the right of prayer, And saints have failed to pray: What loss sustained beyond repair! How blind of heart are they!

### Verse 2

The Father speaketh in His words, He talks no other way! And to converse with Him, our Lord, We must take time to pray!

### Verse 3

There is no trial grief, of pain, No monment of the day, But that we may in Jesus' name Incline our souls and pray!

### Chorus

Pray in the Morning, in the Noontime, in the Evening, Pray when your happy, when in sorrow, when you're tempted, Pray anytime, Pray all the time.
