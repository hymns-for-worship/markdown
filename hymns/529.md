# 529 - Prayer Is The Soul's Sincere Desire

## Notation

F - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, Unuttered or expressed; The motion of a hidden fire That trembles in the breast.

### Verse 2

 Prayer is the simplest form of speech That infant lips can try; Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach The Majesty on high. 

### Verse 3

 Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice, Returning from his ways; While angels in their songs rejoice And cry, "Behold, he prays!"

### Verse 4

 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, The Christian's native air; His watchword at the gates of death: He enters heav'n with prayer.  

### Verse 5

 O Thou, by whom we come to God, The Life, the Truth, the Way, The path of prayer Thyself hast trod: Lord, teach us how to pray!
