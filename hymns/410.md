## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord; She is His new creation By water and the word; From heav'n He came and sought her To be His holy bride; With His own blood He bought her,

### Verse 2

 Elect from ev'ry nation, Yet one o'er all the earth; Her charter of salvation: One Lord, one faith, one birth; One holy name she blesses, Partakes one holy food, And to one hope she presses With ev'ry grace endued.

### Verse 3

Mid toil and tribulation, And tumult of her war, She waits the consummation Of peace forevermore; Till with the vision glorious, Her longing eyes are blest, And the great church victorious
Shall be the church at rest. 

### Coda

Amen.
