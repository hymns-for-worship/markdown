## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How to reach the masses, men of ev'ry birth? For an answer Jesus gave a key, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, Will draw all men unto Me."


### Verse 2

O the world is hungry for the living bread, Lift the Savior up for them to see, Trust Him and do not doubt the words that He said, "I'll draw all men unto Me."

### Verse 3

Lift Him up by living as a Christian ought, Let the world in you the Savior see, Then men will gladly follow Him who once taught, "I'll draw all men unto Me."


### Chorus

Lift Him up, lift Him up, Still He speaks from eternity, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, Will draw all men unto Me."
Lift the precious Savior up, lift the precious Savior up,
