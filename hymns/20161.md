### Verse 1

Glory to God! In all lamentation, Teach us to suffer like our Lord; Then may we seek Thy holy compassion, Our arms outstretched, Thy love outpoured.

### Verse 2

Glory to God! In all tribulation, Measure the portion each can bear; Cover new pain with fresh consolation, Balm for our hearts to heal and share.

### Verse 3

Glory to God! In all our tomorrows, Ready Thy throne for coming pray'rs, Some future tears, or some distant sorrows; Be Thou our God, our Faithful Care.
