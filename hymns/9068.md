### Verse 1

The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? And he is my strength, the defense of my life. Whom shall I fear? Have mercy, O Lord and answer my cry. Turn not away. For Thou art my help, the God of salvation. Turn not away.

### Verse 2

O Lord, lead me now in Thy path straight and even. Teach me Thy way. I will not despair; Thy goodness sustains me. Teach me Thy way. To dwell in His house all the days of my life: This shall I seek. And, O, to behold the Lord in His beauty! This shall I seek.

### Chorus

Wait, wait, O wait on the Lord. Be strong and take courage! Wait on the Lord. Wait, wait, O wait on the Lord, Be strong and take courage! Yes, wait on the Lord.
