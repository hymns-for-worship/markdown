# 692 - In The Shadow Of The Cross

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As we journey on t'ward heaven's shining goal, We may suffer pain and loss; Burdens only bring us blessings if we live In the shadow of the cross.

### Verse 2

 On the tree of sorrow Jesus died for all, Took upon Himself our dross; As I see Him there I long to ever live In the shadow of the cross

### Verse 3

 There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save, On the sea of life they toss; May we be a light and teach them how to live In the shadow of the cross.

### Chorus

Are you living in the shadow of the cross, Where the Savior took your place? By the cross He'll lead us to that home above, There we'll see Him face to face.
