## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Lord, may our faith be like Abraham's, Our path, the path he trod; Our gifts from Thee, sacrificed as alms, Our name, the "Friend of God."

### Verse 2

 Like other's faith, Lord, may our faith be, At work in times of fear, Protecting men who would die for Thee On noble missions here. 

### Verse 3

 Lord, may we be like the patient man, Whose faith could long endure, Tho' blessed by Thee, tried and blessed again, In all, remaining pure.

### Verse 4

 And may our pray'rs, like the faithful pray'rs Of prophets long ago, Call down Thy pow'r, so that ev'rywhere, The cause of Christ will grow.
