## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend, and we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend; if we come to Him in faith, His protection to share, what a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

### Verse 2

Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near, with a tender compassion His children to hear; when He tells us we may cast at His feet every care, what a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

### Verse 3

At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him, we believe that the blessing we're needing we'll surely receive; in the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care, what a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

### Chorus

Blessed hour of prayer, blessed hour of prayer, what a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
