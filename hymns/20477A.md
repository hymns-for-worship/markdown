## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I stand before the cross of Christ, Beneath His outstretched arms. I stand amazed at His loving grace, His care which never harms.

### Verse 2

I stand before the cross of Christ, To eat this precious bread. I stand in tho't of His body torn, That day of awful dread.  

### Verse 3

I stand before the cross of Christ, And drink this cup of blood. I stand forgiv'n by its saving pow'r, The fountain's cleansing flood.

### Verse 4

I stand before the cross of Christ, And hear Him say "forgive!" I stand redeemed by the sacrifice, And I shall always live.

### Chorus

I stand before the cross. O, what an awful cost! I stand before the cross, Looking up at Jesus as He died!
