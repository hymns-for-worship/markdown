## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Upon the day appointed, God will claim my weary soul, And with His faithful army, heaven's joys I shall behold.

### Verse 2

My soul will sigh no longer, I will have eternal rest, There Christ in shining glory will enfold me to His breast.

### Verse 3

No dark of night can shadow the pure light from heaven's realm, Black clouds of earthly trials cannot rise to overwhelm.

### Chorus

I shall weep no tears of sadness. Ev'ry care and sorrow past. No cries of mortal anguish, I am safely home at last.

### Verse 4

O how my heart is yearning for the vision of His face. With spirit eyes beholding heaven's goal of saving grace.
