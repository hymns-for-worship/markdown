## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a home above the blue, waiting there for me and you. There will be no pain or sorrow there.  Only joy and peace will be, and with saved ones there to see, In that beautiful home above the blue.

### Verse 2

There's a Savior up above, gave His life to prove His love, So that we may have eternal life. He will lead us day by day in the strait and narrow way, To that beautiful home above the blue.

### Verse 3

There is nothing can compare with His tender, loving care, If we keep our trust in Him each day. His great truth does teach us all, and prepares us for His call, To that beautiful home above the blue.

### Coda

Home, Home, Beautiful home, Where we'll never more roam.
