## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thine is the glory, Risen, conqu'ring Son; Endless is the vict'ry Thou o’er death hast won. Angels in bright raiment Rolled the stone away, Kept the folded grave clothes Where Thy body lay.


### Verse 2

Lo, Jesus meets us, Risen from the tomb. Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom; Let His church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing, For the Lord now liveth; Death hath lost its sting. 


### Verse 3

No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life! Life is naught without Thee; Aid us in our strife; Make us more than conqu'rors, Thru Thy deathless love; Bring us safe thru Jordan To Thy home above. 

### Chorus

Thine be the glory, Risen, conqu'ring Son; Endless is the vict'ry Thou o’er death hast won.
