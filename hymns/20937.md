## Notation

Dm - 6/4 on 6 - LA

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Before I took a single step, He knew where each would fall; Before I drew a single breath, My Lord had known them all.

### Verse 2

Before I'd ever grieved His heart With sins I tho't were small; Or spoken restless evil words, My Lord had known them all.

### Verse 3

Before my will and His were one, Before I heard Him call; Before I turned to Glory's praise, My Lord had known it all.

### Coda

But God revealed the way for me So I could see His face; And thus He lavished on my soul The riches of His grace. The riches of His grace.
