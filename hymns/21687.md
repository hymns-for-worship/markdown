### Verse 1

O Lord of heav'n, and earth, and sea, To Thee all praise and glory be; How shall we show our love to Thee, Who givest all?



### Verse 2

The golden sunshine, vernal air, Sweet flow'rs and fruits Thy love declare; Where harvests ripen, Thou art there, Who givest all!



### Verse 3

For peaceful homes, and healthful days, For all the blessings earth displays, We owe Thee thankfulness and praise, Who givest all!

### Verse 4

Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, but gav'st Him for a world undone, And freely, with that blessed One, Thou givest all!

### Verse 5

For souls redeemed, for sins forgiv'n, For means of grace and hope of heav'n, O Lord, what can to Thee be giv'n, Who givest all?

### Verse 6

Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee, Repaid a thousandfold will be; Then gladly will we give to Thee, Who givest all!
