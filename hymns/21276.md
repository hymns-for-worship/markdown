## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Judgment is surely coming, Coming to you and me, We will be judged that morning For all eternity; Some will go into Heaven, Others will be denied; Will you be in that number Standing outside?

### Verse 2

Standing outside while loved ones, Enter the pearly gate, Knowing that there forever, You will then separate; To be away from loved ones And by your God denied; O what an awful picture, Standing outside!

### Verse 3

Can you not see the picture Of those who're lost in sin, Standing outside the portals, Without a hope to win? Souls crushed with deepest sorrow, Without a friend to guide? O what an awful picture, Standing outside!

### Chorus

Standing outside the portals, Standing outside denied, Knowing that with the demons Ever you shall abide; Never to share the beauties, Waiting the sanctified, O what an awful picture, Standing outside!
