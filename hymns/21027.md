## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tho' your heart may be heavy with sorrow and care, You may others to gladness beguile, If a face like the light of the morning you wear, And carry your cross with a smile!

### Verse 2

Let the well by the wayside that flows unto all, Strength impart for each step of the mile; Let your faith the great promises often recall, And carry your cross with a smile!

### Verse 3

For the work that you faithfully, willingly do, You shall reap a reward afterwhile; Only grace in your service can glorify you, So carry your cross with a smile!

### Chorus

Carry your cross with a smile, Carry your cross with a smile; You may others from sadness to gladness beguile, If you carry your cross with a smile!
