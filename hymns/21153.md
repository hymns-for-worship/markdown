## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I look at the cross upon Calvary, And O what a wonder divine! To think of the wealth it holds for me The riches of heaven are mine.

### Verse 2

I find at the cross blessed victory, And grace for each step of the way; The fount of God's love is flowing free, And sweeter it grows day by day.

### Verse 3

The cross is my hope for eternity No merit have I of my own; The shed blood of Christ my only plea My trust is in Jesus alone.

### Chorus

Blessed Calvary! Precious Calvary! 'Neath thy shadow I'll ever abide; Blessed Calvary! Precious Calvary! 'Twas there Jesus suffered and died.
