## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Fight the good fight with all thy might! Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right; Lay hold on life, and it shall be Thy joy and crown eternally.

### Verse 2

 Run the straight race thru God's good grace, Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face; Life with its way before us lies, Christ is the path, and Christ the prize. 

### Verse 3

 Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide, His boundless mercy will provide; Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

### Verse 4

 Faint not nor fear, His arms are near, He changeth not, and thou art dear, Only believe, and thou shalt see That Christ is all in all to thee.  

### Coda

Amen.
