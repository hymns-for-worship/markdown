## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, how glorious, full of wonder, Is Thy name o'er all the earth, Thou, who wrought creation's splendor, Bringing suns and stars to birth! Rapt in rev'rence, we adore Thee, Marv'ling at Thy mystic ways.
Humbly now we bow before Thee, Lifting up our hearts in praise.

### Verse 2

When we see Thy lights of heaven, Moon and stars, Thy pow'r displayed, What is man that Thou shouldst love him, Creature that Thy hand hath made? Child of earth, yet full of yearning, Mixture strange of good and ill, From Thy ways so often turning, Yet Thy love doth seek him still.

### Verse 3

Thou hast given man dominion O'er the wonders of Thy hand, Made him fly with eagle pinion, Master over sea and land. Soaring spire and ruined city, These our hopes and failures show. Teach us more of human pity, That we in Thine image grow.
