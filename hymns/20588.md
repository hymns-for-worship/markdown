## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When shall His Majesty come down, The faithful to redeem? When shall the skies be filled with cries, Of saints that praise their King? When shall the dead in Christ arise, In wondrous grand array? When shall the saints that know the Lord rise up and fly away?

### Verse 2

When shall each knee in rev'rence bend, Before the Gracious Lamb? When shall each tongue confession make, Unto the Great I Am? Till then I'll wait and look above, To yonder gracious realm. And join the Master's servants all to praise and honor Him.

### Coda

To praise and honor Him, Amen To praise and honor Him.
