## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Awake, and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb; Wake, ev'ry heart and ev'ry tongue, to praise the Savior's name.

### Verse 2

Sing of His dying love; sing of His rising pow'r; sing how He intercedes above for those whose sins He bore.

### Verse 3

Sing on your heav'nly way, ye ransomed sinners sing; sing on, rejoicing ev'ry day in Christ, the glorious King.

### Verse 4

Soon shall you hear Him say, "Ye blessed children, come!" Soon will He call you hence away, and take His pilgrim home.
