# 21277 - STANDING BY THE RIVER

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here I stand beside death's chilly waters waiting for my final call, Standing by the river looking beyond; Gazing t'ward the land of fadeless beauty where no surges rise and fall, Standing by the river looking beyond.

### Verse 2

Music from the land of endless glory fall upon my list'ning ear, Standing by the river looking beyond; Faces of my friends I often vision, forms of loved ones oft appear, Standing by the river looking beyond.

### Verse 3

Shadows of the night are swiftly falling, lo, I hear the boatman's soar, Standing by the river looking beyond; Many are the voices sweetly calling, I must tarry here no more, Standing by the river looking beyond.

### Chorus

Standing by the river waiting for the boatman, List'ning to the music on the other shore; I can hear the angels singing out a welcome, With my friends and loved ones who have gone before.
