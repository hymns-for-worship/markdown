### Verse 1

I lighten a burden with love, As part of my Master's design, And know in that moment of care: The joy of a servant is mine!

### Verse 2

I serve in a small quiet way, And glory, my Master, is Thine! What more can I ask of this day? The joy of a servant is mine!

### Verse 3

To live in Thy service each day, My strength and my will I resign. Though I am a child of Thy house, The joy of a servant is mine!
