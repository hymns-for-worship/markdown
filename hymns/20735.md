# 20735 - IF THAT ISN'T LOVE

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He left the splendor of heaven, Knowing His destiny Was the lonely hill of Golgotha, There to lay down His life for me.

### Verse 2

Even in death He remembered The thief hanging by His side; He spoke with love and compassion Then He took him to Paradise.

### Chorus

If that isn't love the ocean is dry, There's no stars in the sky, and the sparrow can't fly! If that isn't love then heaven's a myth, There's no feeling like this If that isn't love.
