## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Stand fast in the faith of Christ, Always eager to defend; Put on the whole armor of God, And having done all to stand.


### Verse 2

Stand girded about with truth, Don't turn from the narrow way; Remember God in your youth, In the Master's footsteps stay.


### Verse 3

Stand with Christ, His Word is true, O don't you neglect this friend; He knows just what is best for you, He'll go with you to the end.


### Verse 4

Now let all know where you stand, Ever loyal and true remain; Always let Christ have command, Then a home above you'll gain.

### Chorus

Stand for the things which Christ stood for, Stand for the things which Christ died for, Stand, seek and ask for the old paths, Stand, take heed lest you fall.
