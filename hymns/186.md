# 186 - I Stand Amazed

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the nazarene, and wonder how he could love me, a sinner condemned, unclean.

### Verse 2

For me it was in the garden he pray'd not my will but thine, he cried with tears in his sorrow and sweatdrops of blood for mine.

### Verse 3

He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them his very own; He bore the burden to calvary, and suffered and died alone.

### Verse 4

When with the ransomed in glory his face I at last shall see, twill be my love thru the ages to sing of his love for me.

### Chorus

O how marvelous, o how wonderful, and my song shall ever be: O how marvelous, o how wonderful is my savior's love for me!
