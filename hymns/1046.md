## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I may not understand the way You answer ev'ry prayer, But ev'rytime I talk to You, I understand You care. I may not always hold my own when pain and fear attack, But ev'rytime I take Your hand, I hold the strength I lack.

### Verse 2

I may not always know the words to tell You how I feel, But ev'rytime I bow in prayer, Your hand is there to heal. I may not always be as strong as You would have me be, But ev'rytime I pray to You, I know You still love me.

### Verse 3

I may not always find my way or trust my eyes to see, But ev'rytime I lift them up, I find You're leading me. I may not always mend the hopes that life has torn apart, But ev'rytime I turn to You, You mend my broken heart.
