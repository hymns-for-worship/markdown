## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With thankful hearts we meet, O Lord, To sing Thy praise, to hear Thy word, To seek Thy face in earnest prayer, To cast on Thee each earthly care.




### Verse 2

Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen flock, Thy people's shield, their shad'wing rock, Once more we meet to hear Thy voice, Once more before Thee to rejoice.

### Verse 3

O may Thy servants, by Thy word, Refresh each wearied heart, dear Lord, Wearied of earth's vain strife and woe, Wearied of sin and all below.


### Verse 4

Thy presence, Savior, now we seek, Confirm the strong, sustain the weak; Wayworn and tried, we hither come, Give us a foretaste of our home.
