## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Darkness is falling the night draweth nigh, shadows fall dark on the lea; voices of saved ones are beckoning come, over the sunset sea.

### Verse 2

Our hearts are heavy as they journey on, leaving a dear memory; Jesus is waiting to welcome them home, over the sunset sea.

### Verse 3

When my long journey on this earth is o'er, dear Lord, I'm coming to thee; ever to rest in that heavenly home, over the sunset sea.

### Chorus

Soon I shall journey to heaven my home, and from all sorrow be free; harbor lights gleaming are lighting the way, over the sunset sea.
