## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The little flow'r that opens, The little bird that sings; God made their glowing colors, He made their tiny wings.

### Verse 2

The cold wind in the winter, The pleasant summer sun, The ripe fruits in the garden; He made them ev'ry one,

### Verse 3

He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell How great is God Almighty, Who has made all things well.

### Chorus

All things bright and beautiful, Creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful, The Lord God made them all.
