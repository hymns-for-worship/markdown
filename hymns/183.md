# 183 - Tis Midnight, And On Olive's Brow

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tis midnight; and on olives brow the star is dimmed that lately shown; tis midnight in the garden, now the suffering savior prays alone.

### Verse 2

Tis midnight and for others guilt, the man of sorrows weeps in blood; yet he who hath in anguish knelt is not forsaken by his God.

### Verse 3

Tis midnight and from heavenly plains is born the song that angels know; unheard by mortals are the strains that sweetly soothe the savior's woe.
