How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believers ear! It souths his sorrows heals his wounds, and drives away his fear, and drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole, and calms the troubled breast; tis manna to the hungry soul, and to the weary, rest, and to the weary, rest.

Weak is the effort of my heart and cold my warmest thought; but when I see thee as thou art, I'll praise thee as I ought, I'll praise thee as I ought.

### Verse 4

Till then I would thy love proclaim with every fleeting breathe, and may the music of thy name refresh my soul in death, refresh my soul in death.
