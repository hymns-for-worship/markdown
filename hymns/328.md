Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In God's green pasture feeding, by the cool waters lie, soft in the evening walk my lord and I, all the sheep of his pastures fare so wondrously fine, his sheep am I.

### Verse 2

In God's way gently leading, o'er the path low or high, early in the morning walk my lord and I, all the sheep of his pastures fare so wondrously fine, his sheep am I.

### Chorus

Waters cool, pastures green, in the evening walks my lord and I, dark the night, rough the way, step by step, my lord and I.
