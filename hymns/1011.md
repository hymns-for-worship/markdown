# 1011 - I Will Wake The Dawn With Praises

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dawn and sunset, fierce and joyful, each reflect his mighty ways. With the sea and sky before me, I will give him all my praise.

### Verse 2

Stars and joy in praises from me; "lesser light" will know my voice. When I give my God His glory, night will hear me and rejoice.

### Verse 3

Shout his glory, brothers, sisters; laud his name and do his will. Like the sands upon the shoreline are the praises due Him still.

### Chorus

I will surely wake the dawn with praises! I will surely speak His name abroad. I will worship Him forever, He my Lord, my only God.
