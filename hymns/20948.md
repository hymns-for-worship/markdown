## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Angels we have heard on high, Sweetly singing o'er the plains: And the mountains in reply, Echoing their joyous strains.

### Verse 2

Shepherds, why this jubilee? Why your joyous strains prolong? What the gladsome tidings be Which inspire your heav'nly song?

### Verse 3

Come to Bethlehem, and see Him whose birth the angels sing; Come, adore on bended knee Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

### Verse 4

See Him in a manger laid, Whom the choirs of angels praise; Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, While our hearts in love we raise?

### Chorus

Gloria in excelsis Deo! Gloria in excelsis Deo!
