## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is sunshine in my soul today, More glorious and bright Than glows in any earthly sky, For Jesus is my light.

### Verse 2

There is music in my soul today, A carol to the King, And Jesus, listening, can hear The songs I cannot sing.

### Verse 3

Â There is gladness in my soul today, And hope and praise and love, For blessings which He gives me now, For joys laid up above. 

### Chorus

O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine, While the peaceful happy moments roll; When Jesus shows His smiling face There is sunshine in my soul.
