## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One single drop of rain, Your salty tear became blue ocean. One tiny grain of sand turning in Your hand a world in motion. You're out beyond the furthest morning star, close enough to hold me in Your arms. 

### Verse 2

One timid faithful knock resounds upon the Rock of Ages. One trembling heart and soul becomes a servant bold and courageous. You call across the mountains and the seas. I answer from the deepest part of me.

### Chorus

Adonai! Adonai! I lift up my heart and I cry, my Adonai! You are maker of each moment, Father of my hope and freedom. O, my Adonai!
