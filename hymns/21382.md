## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 3

Thou, who hear'st each contrite sigh, Bidding sinful souls draw nigh, Willing not that one should die, We beseech Thee, hear us.

### Verse 1

Father, hear Thy children's call; Humbly at Thy feet we fall, Prodigals, confessing all: We beseech Thee, hear us.

### Verse 2

Blind, we pray that we may see, Bound, we pray to be made free, Stained, we pray for sanctity: We beseech Thee, hear us.

### Verse 4

By the love that longs to bless, Pitying our sore distress, Leading us to holiness, We beseech Thee, hear us.

### Verse 5

By the love which speaks within, Calling us to flee from sin, And the joy of goodness win, We beseech Thee, hear us.

### Coda

Amen.
