## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lift up your heads, O ye gates. Be lifted up, ye doors. The King of Glory enters in to reign till time's no more. The Lord of hosts is now the King. Worthy of praise which I now bring. Glory and honor to His Name; He is the King of Kings.

### Verse 2

Lift up your heads, O ye gates. Be lifted up, ye doors. The King of Glory enters in to reign till time's no more. Of Christ my King I'll ever sing. My lips shall praises ever ring. A living sacrifice I bring; I bow before my King.

### Verse 3

Lift up your heads, O ye gates. Be lifted up, ye doors. The King of Glory enters in to reign till time's no more. My pray'rs are offered in the name of Him who ever is the same. My lips His name shall ever frame; He intercedes for me.
