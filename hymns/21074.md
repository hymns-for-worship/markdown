## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are days so dark that I seek in vain For the face of my Friend Divine; But tho' darkness hide, He is there to guide By the touch of His hand on mine.

### Verse 2

There are times, when tired of the toilsome road, That for ways of the world I pine; But He draws me back to the upward track By the touch of His hand on mine.

### Verse 3

When the way is dim, and I cannot see Thru the mist of His wise design, How my glad heart yearns and my faith returns By the touch of His hand on mine.

### Verse 4

In the last sad hour, as I stand alone Where the powers of death combine, While the dark waves roll He will guide my soul By the touch of His hand on mine.

### Chorus

O, the touch of His hand on mine, O, the touch of His hand on mine! There is grace and pow'r in the trying hour, In the touch of His hand on mine.
