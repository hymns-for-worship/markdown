## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 My stubborn will at last hath yielded; I would be Thine and Thine alone; And this the prayer my lips are bringing, "Lord, let in me Thy will be done."


### Verse 2

I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary; The darksome path hath dreary grown; But now a light has ris'n to cheer me: I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.


### Verse 3

 Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior, Doth now embrace and compass me; All discords hushed, my peace a river, My soul a prisoned bird set free. 

### Verse 4

Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever, My wayward feet no more to roam; What pow'r from Thee my soul can sever? The cen-ter of God's will my home.

### Chorus

Sweet will of God, Still fold me closer, Till I am wholly lost in Thee; Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
