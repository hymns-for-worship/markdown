## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Behold a stranger at the door! He gently knocks, has knocked before, Has waited long, is waiting still; You treat no other friend so ill.

### Verse 2

But will He prove a Friend indeed? He will, the very Friend you need! The Man of Nazareth tis He, With garments dyed at Calvary.

### Verse 3

O lovely attitude! He stands With melting heart and laden hands! O matchless kindness and He shows This mathless kindness to His foes.

### Verse 4

Admit Him, for the human breast Ne'er entertained so kind a guest; No mortal toungue their joys can tell With whom He condescends to dwell.
