## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How our hearts ache with grief as we say goodby, We shall meet some day; Where no sorrow or tears ever dim the eye, We shall meet some day.

### Verse 2

When we've all crossed the stream with its rolling tide, We shall meet some day; In the city of rest on the other side, We shall meet some day.

### Verse 3

What a glorious tho't as we say goodby, We shall meet some day; In that beautiful home that's prepared on high, We shall meet some day.

### Chorus

We shall meet where no storm clouds gather, We shall meet some day; By the river of life, sparkling, cool and clear, We shall meet some day.
