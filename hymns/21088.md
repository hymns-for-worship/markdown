# 21088 - NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN HEAVEN

## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 6 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There’s no disappointment in Heaven, No weariness, sorrow or pain; No hearts that are bleeding and broken, No song with a minor refrain. The clouds of our earthly horizon Will never appear in the sky, For all will be sunshine and gladness, With never a sob or a sigh.

### Verse 2

We’ll never pay rent for our mansion, The taxes will never come due, Our garments will never grow threadbare, But always be fadeless and new, We’ll never be hungry or thirsty, Nor languish in poverty there, For all the rich bounties of Heaven His sanctified children will share.

### Verse 3

There’ll never be crepe on the doorknob, No funeral train in the sky; No graves on the hillsides of glory, For there we shall nevermore die. The old will be young there forever, Transformed in a moment of time; Immortal we’ll stand in His like-ness, The stars and the sun to outshine. 

### Chorus

I’m bound for that beautiful city, My Lord has prepared for His own; Where all the redeemed of all ages Sing "Glory!" around the white throne; Sometimes I grow homesick for Heaven, And the glories I there shall behold; What a joy that will be when my Savior I see, In that beautiful city of gold.
