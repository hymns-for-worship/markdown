### Verse 1

The friend of Christ, by death embraced His soul by God was kept: That He might glorify His Son The day when Jesus wept.

### Verse 2

Men wondered why He long delayed as friends their vigil kept. They questioned if He had the pow'r, The day when Jesus wept.

### Verse 3

In anguish sore, the sisters cried in grief while Laz'rus 'slept.' The human pains of Christ were seen The day when Jesus wept.

At His command the stone was moved. He raised the one who 'slept'. Our Lord displayed His might and pow'r The day when Jesus wept.
