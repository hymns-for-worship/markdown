# 266 - Have You Counted The Cost

## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord, where the call of His spirit is lost, and you furry allong with the pleasuremad throng, have you coundted, have you counted the cost?

### Verse 2

You may barter your hope of eternity morn, for a moment of joy at the most, for the glitter of sin and the things it will win; have you counted, have you counted the cost?

### Verse 3

While the door of his mercy is open to you, ere the depth of his love you exhaust, won't you come and be healed, won't you whisper, I yield, have you counted, have you counted the cost?

### Chorus

Have you counted the cost, if your soul shall be lost, tho you gain your whole world for your own? Even now it may be that the line you have crossed, have you counted, have you counted the cost?
