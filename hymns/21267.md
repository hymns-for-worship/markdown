## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If God made the sun so bright, If God made the moon for night. If God made the world for me, That's why I believe.

### Verse 2

If God made the trees so high, If God made the birds that fly, If God made the notes they sing, That's why I believe.

### Verse 3

If God made man without sin, If God made a mate for him, If God made their love to be, That's why I believe.

### Verse 4

If God made His Son to die, If God made His Spirit rise, If God did all this for me, That's why I believe.

### Chorus

That's why I believe, That's why I believe; If God did all this for me, That's why I believe.
