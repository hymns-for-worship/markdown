# 1027 - Father, Forgive

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"Father, forgive; They know not what they do," Christ cried from the depths of piercing, agonizing pain. Mercy and love, victorious o'er His suff'ring, Flowed forth with the grace their hate could not constrain.

### Verse 2

"Lord, do not hold this sin against their souls." These words Stephen pled before he took his dying breath. Mercy and love prevailed with mighty power, And grace did bestow a peace that conquered death.

### Verse 3

Lord, please forgive the ones who trouble me; Theyknow not the hurt and crushing anguish that they give. Mercy and love this triumph over suff'ring, For I realize my own sins, You forgive.
