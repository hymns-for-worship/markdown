## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed Jesus, come to me; Soothe my soul with rays of peace. As I look to you alone, fill me with Your love. 

### Verse 2

Mountains high or valleys low You will never let me go. By Your fountain let me drink; Fill my thirsty soul. Glorious, marvelous grace that rescued me; Holy, worthy is the Lamb who died for me. 

### Verse 3

Blessed Jesus, come to me; As I fall down at Your feet, Let me touch Your nailscarred hands; Jesus I would see. Glorious, marvelous grace that rescued me; Holy, worthy is the Lamb who died for me. Holy, worthy! Holy, worthy is the Lamb who died for me;  Is the Lamb who died for me!  Holy, worthy!
