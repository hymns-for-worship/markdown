## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've reached the land of corn and wine And all its riches freely mine; Here shines undimmed one blessful day, for all my night has passed away.

### Verse 2

My Savior comes and walks with  me, And sweet communion here have we; He gently leads me by His hand, for this is heaven's borderland.

### Verse 3

A sweet perfume upon the breeze Is borne from eververnal trees, and flow'rs that, neverfading, grow Where streams of life forever flow.

### Chorus

O Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land, As on thy highest mount I stand, I look away across the sea, Where mansions are prepared for me, and view the shining gloryshore, My heav'n, my home for evermore!

### Verse 4

The zephyrs seem to float to me, Sweet sounds of heaven's melody, As angels with the whiterobed throng Join in the sweet redemption Song.
