## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Again the Lord of light and life Awakes the kindling ray, Unseals the eyelids of the morn, And pours increasing day.

### Verse 2

O what a night was that which wrapt The heathen world in gloom! O what a Sun which rose this day Triumphant from the tomb!

### Verse 3

This day be grateful homage paid, And loud hosannas sung; Let gladness dwell in ev'ry heart, And praise on ev'ry tongue.

### Verse 4

Ten thousand diff'rent lips shall join To hail this welcome morn, Which scatters blessings from its wings To nations yet unborn.
