# 170 - In Gethsemane Alone

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O what wondrous love I see freely shown for you and me, by the one who did atone! Just to show His matchless grace, Jesus suffered for the race, in gethsemane, alone.

### Verse 2

Tarry here he told the three, "tarry here and watch for me," but they heard no bitter moan; for the three disciples slept while my loving savior wept in gethsemane, alone.

### Verse 3

Long in anguish, deep was he, weeping there for you and me, for our sin to Him was known; we should love Him evermore for the anguish that he bore in gethsemane, alone.

### Chorus

O, what love, matchless love, o, what love for me was shown! His forever I would be for the love he gave to me, when He suffered all alone.
