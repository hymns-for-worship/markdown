## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Our Savior once wandered on earth as a man, Both footsore and weary to Samaria's land, A story He told, most wondrously grand, Salvation thru Jesus for poor sinful man!



### Verse 2

Sore, weary, and thirsty, He came to a well, And there, to a woman, this story did tell, She heard it with joy, for her soul could be free, And she this salvation thru Jesus did see!


### Verse 3

Then brother, let's sing this sweet story, so true, Salvation thru Jesus, for me and for you! Let ev'ry glad heart this great message now tell, The same and sweet story, there, told at the well!

### Chorus

We'll sing this sweet song, this glorious song, Of Jesus who died on the tree! He died on the tree, for you and for me! O, sing the sweet story, Salvation is free!
