## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Scattering precious seed by the wayside, Scattering precious seed by the hillside; Scattering precious seed o'er the field, wide, Scattering precious seed by the way.

### Verse 2

Scattering precious seed for the growing, Scattering precious seed, freely sowing; Scattering precious seed, trusting knowing, surely the Lord will send it the rain.

### Verse 3

Scattering precious seed, doubting never, Scattering precious seed, trusting ever; Sowing the word with pray'r and endeavor, Trusting the Lord for growth and for yield.

### Chorus

Sowing in the morning, Sowing at the noontide; Sowing in the e'ning, Sowing the precious seed by the way.
