## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We are people called to an uncommon purpose, a fam'ly forged by the nailscarred hands. Standing together on the Rock of Ages; bound together by the blood of the Lamb. Fellowship is the bond of believers. Fellowship is a threestranded cord. Fellowship is concern and compassion. Fellowship in the name of the Lord. 

### Verse 2

When someone cries there's a warm reassurance, when someone laughs there's an echo of cheer. Shar-ing together in a sweet communion set before us by a God who came near. Fellowship is the bond of believers. Fellowship is a threestranded cord. Fellowship is concern and compassion. Fellowship in the name of the Lord.
