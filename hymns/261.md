## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beautiful robes so white, beautiful land of light; beautiful home so bright, where we shall come no night; beautiful crown I'll wear, shining in bright o'er there, yonder in mansions fair, gather us there.

### Verse 2

Beautiful thot to me, we shall forever be, thine in eternity, when from this world we're free; free from its toils and cares, heavenly joys to share, let me cross over there; this is my prayer.

### Verse 3

Beautiful things on high, over in yonder sky, thus I shall leave this shore counting my treasures o'er, where we shall never die, carry me by and by, never to sorrow more, heavenly store.

### Chorus

Beautiful robes of white, beautiful land of light, beautiful home so bright, beautiful band of might, beautiful, beautiful crown, shining, yes shining so fair, beautiful mansion bright gather us there.
