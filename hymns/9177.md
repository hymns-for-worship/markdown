## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire, Redemption's only spring, Creator of the world art Thou, Its Savior and its King.

### Verse 2

How vast the mercy and the love Which laid our sins on Thee, And led Thee to a cruel death To set Thy people free.

### Verse 3

But now the bonds of death are burst, The ransom has been paid; And Thou art on Thy Father's throne, In glorious robes arrayed.

### Verse 4

O Christ, be Thou our lasting joy, Our ever great reward; Our only glory may it be To glory in the Lord!
