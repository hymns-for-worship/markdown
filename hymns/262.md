## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some day in Jesus' name the sun will shine again, hope on, nor hope in vain, twill come some day! Grief then, shall change to joy, God's will our powers employ, and sin no more destroy, some blessed day!

### Verse 2

Some day we'll need no sun, twill mean that heaven's begun, with all earths battles won, when dawns that day! With shadows past, and woe, all dark things clearer grow, and we great joy shall know some blessed day!

### Verse 3

Perhaps it soon may be that shadows dark shall flee, and from earth's fetters free, we'll great that day! Thru grace from heaven's throne, not merit of our own, we'll find a better home some better day!
