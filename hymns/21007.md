## Notation

B - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some golden day the heart shall reap What once in tears was sown, And longing eyes shall never weep, Nor feet shall walk alone.

### Verse 2

The seed, tho' sown in darkest night, Shall one day bloom and bear, And gleaners in the morning light, Will find the harvest there.

### Verse 3

That golden day is free from fears, And cares no more annoy, the heart that oft has sown in tears, Shall reap someday in joy.

### Chorus

The heart shall reap in joy, the heart shall reap in joy, The heart that oft has sown in tears, Shall reap someday in joy.
