## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Now shall my inward joys arise, And burst into a song; Almighty love inspires my heart, And pleasure tunes my tongue.

### Verse 2

God, on His thirsty Zion's hill, Some mercy drops has thrown; And solemn oaths have bound His love To show'r salvation down.

### Verse 3

Why do we then indulge our fears, Suspicions and complaints? Is He a God, and shall His grace Grow weary of His saints?
