## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I cannot breathe enough of Thee, O gentle breeze of love! More fragrant than the myrtle tree, The Rose of Sharon is to me: The balm of heav'n above, The balm of heav'n above.

### Verse 2

I cannot gaze enough on Thee, Thou Fairest of the fair! My heart is fill'd with ecstasy, As in Thy face of radiancy: I see such beauty there, I see such beauty there.

### Verse 3

I cannot work enough for Thee, My Savior, Master, Friend; I do not wish to go out free, But ever, always, willingly: To serve Thee to the end, To serve Thee to the end.

### Verse 4

I cannot sing enough of Thee, The sweetest name on earth; A note so full of melody Comes from my heart so joyously: And fills my soul with mirth, And fills my soul with mirth.

### Verse 5

I cannot speak enough of Thee, I have so much to tell; Thy heart it beats so tenderly As Thou dost draw me close to Thee: And whisper, "All is well," And whisper, "All is well."
