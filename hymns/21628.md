## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On the brightest day in the glowing sun, When my prayers come easy, The battles won; I'll remember, Lord, Your words strong and clear, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears." 



### Verse 2

In the hour of pain, in the dark of night, When my heart is aching And grief I fight, I will hear Your voice As You draw me near, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears."


### Verse 3

When the days are long And I'm all alone, When my strength is fading, My health is gone; You will sit with me And will calm my fears: "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears."


### Chorus

For I know, Dear Lord, That Your love is great, That the hope of heaven is worth the wait. I will ponder well, Thru the coming years: "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears."
