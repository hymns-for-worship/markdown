### Verse 1

He'll go with me on that journey by and by. He'll go with  me on that journey to the skies. I won't have to alone, He will take me safely home. He'll go with me on that journey by and by.  

### Verse 2

He will take me home to glory by and by, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. He'll go with me all the way, He won't let me go astray. He'll go with me on my journey by and by.

### Chorus

He'll go with me, He'll go with me, Go with me as I travel to my home beyond the skies, He'll go with me, He'll go with me, Go with me on my journey by and by.
