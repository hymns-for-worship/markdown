## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims, Nor think the moments long, My faith is heav'nward rising With ev'ry tuneful song; Lo! on the mount of blessing, The glorious mount, I stand; And looking over Jordan, I see the promised land. 

### Verse 2

 Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims, While here on earth we stay; Let songs of home and Jesus Beguile each fleeting day; Sing on the grand old story Of His redeeming love, The everlasting chorus That fills the realms above. 

### Verse 3

 Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims, The time will not be long, Till in our Father's kingdom We swell a nobler song, Where those we love are waiting to greet us on the shore, We'll meet beyond the river, Where surges roll no more. 

### Chorus

Sing on, O blissful music! With ev'ry note you raise My heart is filled with rapture, My soul is lost in praise; Sing on, O blissful music! With ev'ry note you raise My heart is filled with rapture, My soul is lost in praise.
