## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 9 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There will come a glad day in the sweet by and by, When the ransomed shall stand at the judgment on high, O, what will you say, will your record be fair, Will He answer "well done"


### Verse 2

When that morning shall dawn and our trials are o'er We shall fly away home to that bright peaceful shore, A robe and a crown will await for you there, If He answers, "well done"


### Chorus

Will He answer "well done" when your name is called there, Will He welcome you home to a mansion so fair? Enter in weary one, you are free from all care. Will He answer, "well done"  When your name is called there?
