## Notation

D - 2/2 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Flung to the heedless winds, Or on the waters cast, The martyrs' ashes, watched, Shall gathered be at last.

### Verse 2

And from that scattered dust, Around us and abroad, Shall spring a plenteous seed Of witnesses for God.

### Verse 3

The Father hath received Their latest living breath, And vain is Satan's boast Of vict'ry in their death.

### Verse 4

Still, still, tho' dead, they speak, And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim To many_a wak'ning land, The one availing Name.
