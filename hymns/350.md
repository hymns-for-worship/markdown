## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I know not why God's wondrous grace to me he has made known, nor why unworthy, christ in love, redeemed me for his own.

### Verse 2

I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me, of weary ways or golden days before his face I see.

### Verse 3

I know not when my lord may come at night or noonday fair, nor if I'll walk the vail with him or meet him in the air>

### Chorus

But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day.
