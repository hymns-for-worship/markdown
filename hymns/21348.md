## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the trials of this life make you weary, And your troubles seem too much to bear; There's a wonderful solace and comfort In the silent communion of pray'r.

### Verse 2

When you've searched for the sun without ceasing, And the showers continue to fall; There's a heavenly lift in this wonderful gift That God has extended to all. 

### Verse 3

From the blessing of pray'r there comes power That will minimize all your care; And you'll gather new hope when you're able to cope With the troubles that once brought despair. 

### Chorus

So lift up your heart to the heavens; There's a loving and kind Father there Who offers release and comfort and peace, In the silent communion of pray'r.
