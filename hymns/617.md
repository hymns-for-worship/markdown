## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 According to Thy gracious Word, In meek humility, This will I do, my dying Lord, I will remember Thee.

### Verse 2

 Thy body, broken for my sake, My bread from heav'n shall be; Thy testamental cup I take, And thus remember Thee.

### Verse 3

 Gethsemane can I forget? Or there Thy conflict see, Thine agony and bloody sweat, And not remember Thee?

### Verse 4

 When to the cross I turn mine eyes, And rest on Calvary, O Lamb of God, my Sacrifice, I must remember Thee.
