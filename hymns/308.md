## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where love is in the home there's happiness, where love is in the hime, there's joy; tho the fare may simple be, still its very plain to see, where love is in the home, there's joy.

### Verse 2

Where love is in the home there's harmony, where love is in the home there's bliss, if advanced in age you be, you may call to memory, where love is in the home there's bliss.

### Verse 3

Where love is in the home contentment reigns, where love is in the home there's peace; gold and silver cannot buy what it takes to satisfy, where love is in the home there's peace.
