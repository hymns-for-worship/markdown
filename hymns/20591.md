## Lyrics

### Verse 1

After the night of darkest despar, After the night of trembling and fear, We'll burst thru the morning to rays of the sun; After the dark night when this life is done.

### Verse 2

Afer the night of crying and grief, After the night of absent relief, We'll soon see the Savior, God's glorious Son, After the dark night when this life is done. 

### Verse 3

Why should we cry, and why the despair? Why should we grieve as tho' He's not there? He's walking beside us, God's glofious Son, During the dark night and when this life's done. He's walking beside us, God's glorious Son.
