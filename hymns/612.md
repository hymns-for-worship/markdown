# 612 - Love Lifted Me

## Notation

Bb - 6/8 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I was sinking deep in sin, Far from the peaceful shore, Very deeply stained within, Sinking to rise no more; But the Master of the sea Heard my despairing cry, From the waters lifted me, Now safe am I.

### Verse 2

 All my heart to Him I give, Ever to Him I cling, In His blessed presence live, Ever His praises sing; Love so mighty and so true Merits my soul's best songs, Faithful,  loving service,  too, To Him belongs.

### Verse 3

 Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves, He will lift you by His love, Out of the angry waves; He's the Master of the sea, Billows His will obey; He your Savior wants to be —  Be saved today. 

### Chorus

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When nothing else could help, Love lifted me, Love lifted me!
