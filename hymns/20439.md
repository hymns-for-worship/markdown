## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I pass by the place where my friends and loved ones rest, I am made to be so sad and alone. Precious Lord, O stand by me, and let me hold Thy hands so blest. I cannot cross the river alone.

### Verse 2

When I come to the brink and my heart begins to sink, be Thou near to welcome me to Thy home. Lead me safe unto the shore and live with Thee forever more. I cannot cross the river alone.

### Chorus

Precious Lord, Hold my hand when before the bar I stand. I'm Thy servant and Thy child; I'm Thine own. When I reach the raging sea, O be Thou near to comfort me. I cannot cross the river alone.
