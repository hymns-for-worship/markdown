## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Go not far from me, O God; Leave me not to walk alone. As the path of life I plod, Without Thee, all hope is gone.



### Verse 2

If I falter in the way, When life's duties press me sore, Lead me lest I go astray; Go not far from me, O Lord.


### Verse 3

When my heart is filled with dread, For the things I cannot see, By Thy hand I would be led; O Lord, go not far from me.

### Verse 4

Lord, walk on with me alway; All my hope is fixed on Thee; And forever I would pray, O Lord, go not far from me.
