### Verse 1

Let us hold within us still, Visions of dark Calv'ry's hill, Where my Lord was led to die, Where my Lord was lifted high.

Memories we keep of Thee, Precious One that made us free; Lord of love and Lord of light, Son of God who knows no night.

Worthy one, O glorious King, With Thy praise all heaven rings; Awesome host with sweetest lays, Never cease to give Thee praise.
