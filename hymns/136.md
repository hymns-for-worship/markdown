## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O sacred head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down; now scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown; how art Thou pale with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn; how does that visage languish, which once was bright as morn.

### Verse 2

What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend, for this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end? O make me Thine forever; and, should I fainting be, Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.
