## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father, please hear our pleading. Father, we need Thee now. Thou art the only healer. Our hearts are grieving, Please hear our prayer. Hours now without our loved one; Now must be filled somehow. So help us to fill these moments, with acts of kindness, worship and prayer.

### Verse 2

We know that Thou has promised comfort in time of need. We ask Thy tender blessing to fill our hearts now; for this we plead. Friends now are all about us, helping us bear our grief. We thank Thee for all Thy blessings. We feel Thy presence, it brings relief.
