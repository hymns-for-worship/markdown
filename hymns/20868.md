## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Give me the heart of a servant. Tender and faithful and true. Fill me with love then use me O, Lord, so that the world can see You.

### Verse 2

Give me the hands of a servant. Ready Your work to do. Strengthen with hope and mercy and grace, so that the world can see You. 

### Verse 3

Give me the eyes of a servant. Help me to see Your view. People have needs: the love intercedes, so that the world can see You.

### Verse 4

Give me the life of a servant. Humble and grateful, renewed. Yielding my life in selfsacrifice, so that the world can see You.
