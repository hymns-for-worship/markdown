## Lyrics

### Verse 1

So tender, so precious, My Savior to me; So true and so gracious I've found Him to be.

### Verse 2

So patient, so kindly Tow'rd all of my ways; I blunder so blindly He love still repays.

### Verse 3

Of all friends the fairest And truest is He; His love is the rarest That ever can be.

### Verse 4

His beauty, tho' bleeding And circled with thorns, Is then most exceeding, For grief Him adorns.

How can I but love Him? But love Him, But love Him? There's no friend above Him, Poor sinner, for thee.
