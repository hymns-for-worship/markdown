## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a beautiful home beyond the dark river, there's a mansion by faith I can see; and the savior is there, his faithful to welcome, there's a beeautiful home for me.

### Verse 2

Tis a beautiful home, and God is its maker, in a land that no mortal has trod; soon the angels will come and carry me over, to that beautiful home of God.

### Verse 3

I have followed the way of life to the river, I can see the glad portals above; I am ready to go and live with my savior, in the beautiful home of love.

### Chorus

Home on the banks of the river, home where the ransomed ones gather, home with the angels forever, on the beautiful banks of the river.
