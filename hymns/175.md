## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord, we break the bread, in memory, of that great sacrifice on calvary; this we do each Lord's day as Christ has said, bless all disciples now who break the bread.

### Verse 2

Bless thou the cup, dear Lord, to us this day; may we with hearts prepared his words obey; we now his death proclaim in his own way; until he comes again, we keep this day.

### Verse 3

Our savior now doth reign in heav'n above; deaths power he overcame, such matchless love; to heav'n he did ascend, there he's enthroned; he is our dearest friend, for us atoned.
