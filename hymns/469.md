## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Deep in my heart there's a gladness, Jesus has saved me from sin! Praise to His name, what a Savior! Cleansing without and within.

### Verse 2

 Only a glimpse of His goodness, That was sufficient for me; Only one look at the Savior, Then was my spirit set free.

### Verse 3

 He is the fairest of fair ones, He is the Lily, the Rose; Rivers of mercy surround Him, Grace, love and pity He shows. 

### Chorus

Why do I sing about Jesus? Why is He precious to me? He is my Lord and my Savior, Dying, He set me free!
