## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am so happy in Christ today, That I go singing along my way; Yes, I'm so happy to know and say, "Jesus included me too."

### Verse 2

Gladly I read, "Whosoever may Come to the fountain of life today;" But when I read it I always say, "Jesus included me too."

### Verse 3

Ever God's Spirit is saying, "Come!" Hear the Bride saying, "No longer roam;" But I am sure while they're calling home, Jesus included me too.

### Verse 4

"Freely come drink," words the soul to thrill! O with what joy they my heart do fill! For when He said, "Whosoever will," Jesus included me too.

### Chorus

Jesus included me, yes, He included me, When the Lord said "Whosoever," He included me; Jesus included me, yes, He included me, When the Lord said "Whosoever," He included me;
