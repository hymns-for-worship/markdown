### Verse 1

Some day before the throne I'll stand, And with the ransomed be; When they receive their shining crowns, There will be one for me.



### Verse 2

Some day I'll dwell with whiterobed throngs, From sin's defilement free; And sing our blessed Savior's praise Thruout eternity.



### Verse 3

Some day when Jesus calls me home, His glory I shall see; And thru His grace I then shall wear a crown of victory.



Some day when Jesus calls me home, His glory I shall see; And thru His grace I then shall wear a crown of victory.



Some day when Jesus calls me home, His glory I shall see; And thru His grace I then shall wear a crown of victory.



Some day when Jesus calls me home, His glory I shall see; And thru His grace I then shall wear a crown of victory.

There is a crown for me, There is a crown for me; Where saints adore Christ evermore, There is a crown for me.
