## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O listen to our wondrous story, Counted once among the lost; Yet, One came down from heaven's glory, Saving us at awful cost!

### Verse 2

 No angel could His place have taken, Highest of the high though He; The loved One on the cross forsaken, Was one of the Godhead three!

### Verse 3

 Will you surrender to this Savior? To His scepter humbly bow? You, too, shall come to know His favor, He will save you, save you now. 

### Chorus

Who saved us from eernal loss? Who but God's Son upon the cross! What did He do? He died for you! Where is He now? Believe it thou, In heaven interceding!
