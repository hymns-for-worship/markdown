## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The name of Jesus is so sweet, I love its music to repeat; It makes my joy full and complete, The precious name of Jesus.

### Verse 2

I love the name of Him whose heart Knows all my griefs and bears a part; Who bids all anxious fears depart; I love the name of Jesus.

### Verse 3

That name I fondly love to hear, It never fails my heart to cheer, Its music dries the falling tear; Exhalt the name of Jesus. 

### Verse 4

No word of man can ever tell How sweet the name I love so well; O, let its praises ever swell, O, praise the name of Jesus.

### Chorus

"Jesus," O, how sweet the name! "Jesus," ev'ry day the same; "Jesus," let all saints proclaim Its worthy praise forever.
