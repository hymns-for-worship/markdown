## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Just as I am, without one plea, But that thy blood was shed for me, And that thou bids't me come to thee, O lamb of God, I come, I come. I come broken to be mended. I come wounded to be healed. I come desp'rate to be rescued, I come empty to be filled. I come guilty to be pardoned by the blood of Christ, the Lamb, And I'm welcome with open arms praise God, just as I am.

### Verse 2

Just as I am, and waiting not, To rid my soul of one dark blot. To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come, I come I come broken to be mended. I come wounded to be healed. I come desp'rate to be rescued, I come empty to be filled. I come guilty to be pardoned by the blood of Christ, the Lamb, And I'm welcome with open arms praise God, just as I am.

### Verse 3

Just as I am, I would be lost, but mercy and grace my freedom bought. And now to blory in your cross, O Lamb of God, I come, I come. I come broken to be mended. I come wounded to be healed. I come desp'rate to be rescued, I come empty to be filled. I come guilty to be pardoned by the blood of Christ, the Lamb, And I'm welcome with open arms praise God, just as I am.
