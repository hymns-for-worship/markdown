## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is much to do, there's work on ev'ry hand, Hark! the cry for help comes ringing thru the land; Jesus calls for reapers, I must active be, What wilt Thou, O Master? here am I, send me.

### Verse 2

There's the plaintive cry of mourning souls distressed, And the sigh of hearts who seek but find no rest; These should have my love and tender sympathy, Ready at Thy bidding,  here am I, send me.

### Verse 3

There are hung'ring souls who cry aloud for bread, With the bread of life they're longing to be fed; Shall they starve and famish while a feast is free? I must be more faithful,  here am I, send me.

### Chorus

Here am I, send me, Lord, send me, Here am I, send me, Lord, send me, Here am I, send me, Lord, send me,

### Verse 4

There are souls who linger on the brink of woe, Lord, I must not, can not bear to let them go; Let me go and tell them, brother, turn and flee, Master, I would save them, Here am I, send me.
