## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How wonderful is the mercy of Christ, Delivered to us when He died for our sins: Redeeming us, paying the ultimate price, And conquering death, the vict'ry to win.

### Verse 2

How marvelous is the true love of God, Displayed by His patience and unending care: Supplying our needs with His shepherding rod, Protecting from trials, from woes, and from snares.

### Verse 3

How excellent is the sweet fellowship, Bestowed upon us by the Spirit divine: He comforts and guides us so we need not trip; He leads us to heav'n, our home upon high.

### Chorus

The mercy of Christ, the love of God, The fellowship of the Spirit divine. For all these great blessings we offer Him laud And glory and praise to our Lord God on high.
