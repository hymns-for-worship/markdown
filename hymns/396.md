## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O land of rest, for thee I sigh; When will the moment come, When I shall lay my armor by, And dwell in peace at home?

### Verse 2

 No tranquil joys on earth I know, No peaceful shelt'ring dome; This world's a wilderness of woe, This world is not my home.

### Verse 3

 To Jesus Christ I fled for rest; He bade me cease to roam, And lean for succor on His breast, Till He conduct me home. 

### Chorus

We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, And we'll be gathered home.
