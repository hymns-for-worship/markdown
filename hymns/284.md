# 284 - What Will Your Answer Be

## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Someday you'll stand at the bar on high, someday your record you'll see; someday you'll answer the question of life, what will your answer be?

### Verse 2

Sadly you'll stand if you're unprepared, trembling you'll fall on your knee; facing the sentence of life or of death, what will that sentence be?

### Verse 3

Now is the time to prepare my friend, make your soul spotless and free; washed in the blood of the crucified one, he will your answer be.

### Chorus

What will it be? What will it be? Where will you spend eternity? What will it be, o what will it be? What will your answer be?
