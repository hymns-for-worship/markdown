### Chorus

He is able to deliver thee, he is able to deliver thee, tho by sin oppressed, go to him for rest, our God is able to deliver thee.

### Verse 1

Tis the grandest theme thru the ages rung; tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue, tis the grandest theme that the world e'er sung, our God is able to deliver thee.

### Verse 2

Tis the grandest theme in the earth or main; tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain, tis the grandest theme, tell the world again, our God is able to deliver thee.

### Verse 3

Tis the grandest theme let the tidings roll to the guilty heart to the sinful soul; look to God in faith, he will make thee whole, our God is able to deliver thee.
