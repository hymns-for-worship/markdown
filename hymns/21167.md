## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Art thou weary, art thou languid, Art thou sore distressed? "Come to Me" saith One, and coming, Be at rest."

### Verse 2

Hath He marks to lead me to Him, If He be my guide? "In His feet and hands are wound-prints, And His side."

### Verse 3

If I still hold closely to Him, What hath He at last? "Sorrow vanquished, labor ended, Jordan passed."

### Verse 4

If I ask Him to receive me, Will He say me nay! "Not till earth end not till heaven Pass away."
