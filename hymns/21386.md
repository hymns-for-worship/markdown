O what a Savior we have found! Well may we make the world resound, With one continual joyous sound, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Cleansed in our Savior’s precious blood, Filled with the fullness of our God, Walking by faith the path He trod, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Leaning our heads on Jesus’ breast, Knowing the joy of that sweet rest, Finding in Him the chief, the best, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
