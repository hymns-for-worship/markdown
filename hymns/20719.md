### Verse 1

It isn't any trouble just to SMILE. It isn't any trouble just to SMILE. If ever you're in trouble it will vanish like a bubble if you'll only take the trouble just to SMILE.

### Verse 2

It isn't any trouble just to PRAY pray. It isn't any trouble just to PRAY pray. If ever you're in trouble it will vanish like a bubble if you'll only take the trouble just to PRAY pray.

### Verse 3

It is any trouble just to SING sing. It isn't any trouble just to SING sing. If ever you're in trouble it will vanish like a bubble if you'll only take the trouble just to SING sing.
