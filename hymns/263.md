### Verse 1

Have thine affections been nailed to the cross? Is thy heart right with God? Dost thou count all things for Jesus but loss? Is thy heart right with God?

### Verse 2

Hast thou dominion o'er self and o'er sin? Is thy heart right with God? Over all evil, without and within? Is thy heart right with God?

### Verse 3

Are all thy powers under Jesus' control? Is thy heart right with God? Does he each moment abide in thy soul? Is thy heart right with God?

### Chorus

Is thy heart right with God? Washed in the crimson flood, cleansed and made holy, humble and lowly, right in the sight of God?
