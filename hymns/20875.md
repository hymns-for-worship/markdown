## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ready to suffer grief or pain, Ready to stand the test; Ready to stay at home and send Others, if He sees best.

### Verse 2

Ready to go, ready to bear, Ready to watch and pray; Ready to stand aside and give, Till He shall clear the way.

### Verse 3

Ready to speak, ready to think, Ready with heart and brain; Ready to stand, where He sees fit, Ready to bear the strain.

### Chorus

Ready to go, ready to stay, Ready my place to fill; Ready for service, lowly or great, Ready to do His will.

### Verse 4

Ready to speak, ready to warn,Ready o'er souls to yearn; Ready in life, ready in death, Ready for His return.
