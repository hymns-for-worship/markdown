### Verse 1

God, I'm running for Your heart, I'm running for Your heart, 'til I am a soul on fire. Lord, I'm longing for Your ways. I'm waiting for the day when I am a soul on fire, 'til I am a soul on fire. God, I'm running for Your heart, I'm running for Your heart, 'til I am a soul on fire. Lord, I'm longing for Your ways. I'm waiting for the day when I am a soul on fire, 'til I am a soul on fire. Lord, restore the joy I had. I have wandered, bring me back. In this darkness, lead me thru until all I see is You, yeah. God, I'm running for Your heart, I'm running for Your heart, 'til I am a soul on fire. Lord, I'm longing for Your ways. I'm waiting for the day when I am a soul on fire, 'til I am a soul on fire. Lord, let me burn for You again. Let me return to You again. Lord, let me burn for You again. Let me return to You again. I'm waiting for the day when I am a soul on fire, 'til I am a soul on fire.
