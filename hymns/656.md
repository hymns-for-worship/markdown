 Lord God Almighty, Thy strong hand created sky and sea, And lifted from deep sea, dry land, And caused all life to be.

 Lord God Immortal, soon Thy hand shall beckon us to Thee, Ascending to an unknown land, To live eternally.

 Lord God our Maker, Savior, and Eternal Deity, We reach up for Thy mighty hand, For all life comes from Thee.
