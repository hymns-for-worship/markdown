## Notation

G - 6/8 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On the cross of Calvary our blessed Savior died, Gve His life to save the world from loss; In His pain and agony, for ev'ry sin to hide, Shed the blood that stained the old rugged cross.

### Verse 2

To the Cross, the rugged cross they nailed His precious hands, And in death He fully paid the cost, There is pardon in His love for ev'ry one that stands For the blood that stained the old rugged cross.

### Verse 3

What an awful death He died to pardon you and me, All alone in agony He tossed, And a world once lost in sin can now be wholly free By the blood that stained the old rugged cross.

### Chorus

T'was His blood, His precious blood that stained the old rugged cross, T'was His love that paid the awful cost: O soul so far astray come and plunge today In the blood that stained the old rugged cross.
