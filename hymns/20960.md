## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All who are lost in transgression, Flee the avenger of blood! Run to the city of refuge, Wisely appointed by God.

### Verse 2

Quickly your judgment is coming; You cannot fight it nor hide; Only the city has safety; Fly to its gates, and abide.

### Verse 3

There, in the city of refuge, God shelters all who believe; Dwell there, and never forsake it; Death still awaits if you leave.

### Chorus

Tho' you are guilty and sinstained, He has prepared you a place; Run to the city of refuge; Find His abundance of grace!
