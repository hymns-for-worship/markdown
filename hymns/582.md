## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The service of Jesus true pleasure affords, In Him there is joy without an alloy; 'Tis heaven to trust Him and rest on His words; It pays to serve Jesus each day. 

### Verse 2

 It pays to serve Jesus whate'er may betide, It pays to be true whate'er you may do; 'Tis riches of mercy in Him to abide; It pays to serve Jesus each day.

### Verse 3

 Tho' sometimes the shadows may hang o'er the way, And sorrows may come to beckon us home; Our precious Redeemer each toil will repay; It pays to serve Jesus each day. 

### Chorus

It pays to serve Jesus, it pays ev'ry day, It pays ev'ry step of the way; Tho' the pathway to glory may sometimes be drear, You'll be happy each step of the way.
