## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Time is filled with swift transition, Naught of earth unmoved can stand Build your hopes on things eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand.

### Verse 2

 Trust in Him who will not leave you, Whatsoever years may bring, If by earthly friends forsaken, Still more closely to Him cling.

### Verse 3

 When your journey is completed, If to God you have been true, Fair and bright the home in glory Your enraptured soul will view. 

### Chorus

Hold to God's unchanging hand! Hold to God's unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things eternal, Hold to God's unchanging hand.
