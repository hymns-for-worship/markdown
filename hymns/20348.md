## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye. All is peace forevermore on that happy golden shore. What a day, glorious day that will be!

### Verse 2

There'll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear, No more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there. And forever I will be with the One who died for me. What a day, glorious day that will be!

### Chorus

What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see, And I look upon His face the One who saved me by His grace. When He takes me by the hand and leads me thru the Promised Land; What a day, glorious day that will be!
