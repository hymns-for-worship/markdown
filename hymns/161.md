## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Man of sorrows, what a name for the son of God who came ruined sinners to reclaim! Hallelujah! What a savior!

### Verse 2

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, in my place condemed he stood, sealed my pardon with his blood; Hallelujah! What a savior!

### Verse 3

Guilty, vile and helpless we; spotless lamb of God was he; "full atonement!" can it be? Hallelujah! What a savior!

### Verse 4

Lifted up was he to die, it is finished was his cry; now in heav'n exalted high, Hallelujah! What a savior!

### Verse 5

When he comes our glorious king, all his ransomed home to bring, then anew this song we'll sing, Hallelujah! What a savior!
