# 534 - Tell Me The Old, Old Story

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Tell me the old, old Story, Of unseen things above, Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love. Tell me the story simply, As to a little child, For I am weak and weary, And helpless and defiled. 

### Verse 2

 Tell me the story slowly, That I may take it in, That wonderful redemption, God's remedy for sin; Tell me the story often, For I forget so soon: The "early dew" of morning Has passed away at noon.

### Verse 3

 Tell me the story softly, With earnest tones and grave; Remember I'm the sinner Whom Jesus came to save; Tell me the story always, If you would really be, In any time of trouble, A comforter to me.  

### Chorus

Tell me the old, old Story, Tell me the old, old Story, Tell me the old, old Story Of Jesus and His love.
