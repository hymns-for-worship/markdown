## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 For God so loved this sinful world, His Son He freely gave, That whosoever would obey, Eternal life should have.

### Verse 2

 The "whosoever" of the Lord, I trusted was for me; I took Him at His gracious word, From sin He set me free.

### Verse 3

 Eternal life, the promise below, Now fills my heart and soul; I'll sing His praise forevermore, Who has redeemed my soul. 

### Chorus

Tis true, O yes, 'tis true, God's wonderful promise is true, For I've trusted, and tested and tried it, And I know God's promise is true.
