## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Pass me not, O gentle Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. 

### Verse 2

Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded broken spirit, Save me by Thy grace. 

### Verse 3

Let me at Thy throne of mercy Find a sweet relief; Kneeling there in deep contrition, Help my unbelief.

### Verse 4

Thou, the Spring of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Whom in Heav'n but Thee?

### Chorus

Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.
