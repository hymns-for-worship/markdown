## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord our God, we come to You now as our minds are turned to Christ our King. May the words that he spoke stay close to our hearts, and His body be a source of strength. May the bread and the wine receive Your blessing, and our heart feel the pain He bore. Let Your Spirit indwell us now as we take, As disciples of Christ we pray. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! We commune with each other in this feast, Lord. We would ask that our hearts be pure. Let Your Spirit inhabit all of our praise, As disciples of Christ we pray, As disciples of Christ we pray.
