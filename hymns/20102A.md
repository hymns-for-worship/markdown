## Lyrics

### Verse 1

And can it be that I should    gain an int'rest  in my  Savior's Blood? Died He for me, who caused His pain? For me, who scorned His perfect love. Amazing love! How can it be that You, my God, would die for me. 

### Verse 2

You left Your Father's throne above, so free and infinite Your grace. Emptied Yourself of all but love, and bled for Adam's helpless race. Amazing love! How can it be that You, my God, would die for me. 

### Verse 3

Boldly I come before Your throne to claim Your mercy immense and free. No greater love will e'er be known, for O my God it found out me. Amazing love! How can it be that You my God, would die for me.  Amazing love! How can it be that You my God, would die for me. that You, my God, would die that You, my God, would die for me. Amazing love! How can it be?

### Coda
