## Notation

D - 3/4 on 3 - RE

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Between here and sunset there'll be rivers to cross, The winds may beat round me, my ship may be tossed, But the pilot that's guiding my vessel can see Between here and sunset just what's waiting for me.

### Verse 2

As sure as the years number thousands and more, And as sure as the sand lies to rest on the shore, Just as sure as the clouds draw the rain from the sea, Between here and sunset He'll take care of me

### Chorus

And He'll hold back the sun if the need should arise, If the mountain's too steep, He'll just lower the sky, He'll exalt ev'ry valley when they're too rough and steep, And between here and sunset, God will take care of me.
