## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When we walk with the lord in the light of his word what a glory he sheds on our way, while we do his good will, he abides with us still and with all who will trust and obey.

### Verse 2

Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share, but our toil he does richly repay; not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross, but is blest if we trust and obey.

### Verse 3

But we never can prove the delights of his love until all on the alter we lay, for the favor he shows and the joy he bestows are for those who will trust and obey.

### Verse 4

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at his feet or we'll walk by his side in our way, what he says we will do, where he sends we will know, never fear, only trust and obey.

### Chorus

Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
