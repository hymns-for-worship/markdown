## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Our Lord, forevermore the same, Majestic, good, and true, What song of ours can praise Your name? What voice can tell of You?

### Verse 2

Can any mortal tongue confess The light that hides Your face, The splendor of Your holiness  Upon the throne of grace?

### Verse 3

And how can we, who do not know That paradise above, Begin in any song to show The glories of Your love?

### Chorus

But still You hear us, mighty King, Though we are small and flawed; How wonderful that we should sing! We love Your praise, O God!
