# 20811 - LOWER THAN THE ANGELS

## Notation

Dm - 4/4 on 1 - LA

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lower that the angles For a little while; Christ, the Word incarnate, Silent at His trial. See the Lamb unblemished, Sun of righteousness, Sentenced for the kingship That he dares confess.

### Verse 2

Lower than the angles for a little while For a little while; All of His disciples Fled in their denial, Now the hope of Israel, Heir to David's throne, Stunbles to Golgotha, Bleeding and alone.

### Verse 3

Lower than the angles for a little while For a little while; Hear the priest and elders Slander and revile, "Save Yourself, Messiah, "and we will believe!" While the heavens darken And the angles grieve.

### Verse 4

Lower than the angles for a little while For a little while; Jesus, crowned with glory, Death can not defile. Perfect thru His suffring, Now to intercede, Taught to give us mercy In our time of need.
