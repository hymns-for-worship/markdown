Tidings of joy are received by all nations, The Child King is here and will ne're go away. Good news awaited and long in its coming, is here, Praise Jehovah, And ever to stay.

Tidings, sweet tidings glad tidings from Glory, With hearts swelled to bursting, The angles proclaim. Earth now hath Jesus, its King, Its Messiah, The earth with Messiah will ne'er be the same.
