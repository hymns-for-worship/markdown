## Lyrics

### Verse 1

By the pow'r of His Word He created all things, there is no one like my God. He breathed into first man the breath of life and made him a living soul.

### Verse 2

He loved me before I came to be, by grace He gave His only Son. To make me free from sin so I might live with Him, Jesus bore my burden on the cross.

### Chorus

Prase Him, praise Him, O my soul; Praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lord. I wil praise and glorify Him in my life. Praise Him, praise Him, O my soul; Praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lord As long as I live I'll sing the sweetest praise unto my God.
