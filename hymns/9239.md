## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Since by his sin man went astray, Death shadows darken o'er his way; And all must heed the reaper's call, The good and bad, the great and small.

### Verse 2

Our Lord came for an earthly stay, Took Satan's pow'r of death away; When He arose, gave hope to all, Whose faith in God, by Jesus called.

### Verse 3

Dear faithful ones death's call obey, Their spirits rise, O happy day; To paradise where no night falls, God's love is light, pure light for all.

### Verse 4

In glory Christ will come some day, To take saints home to ever stay; When all the dead from graves He's called, And Death is conquered then for all.
