## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On the cross of Calvary, Jesus died for you and me; There He shed His precious blood, That from sin we might be free. O, the cleansing stream doth flow, And it washes white as snow: It was for me that Jesus died On the cross of Calvary.

### Verse 2

O, what wondrous, wondrous love, Bro't me down at Jesus' feet! O, such wondrous, dying love, Asks a sacrifice complete! Lord, I give myself to Thee, Soul and body Thine to be: It was for me Thy blood was shed On the cross of calvary.

### Verse 3

Clouds and darkness veiled the sky, When the Lord was crucified; "It is finished!" was His cry, When He bowed His head and died. It was finished there for me; All the world may now go free: It was for me that Jesus died On the cross of Calvary.

### Chorus

On Calvary, on Calvary It was for me that Jesus died on the cross of Calvary.
