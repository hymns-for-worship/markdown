## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On this Lord's day we assemble round the table of the Lord; happy hearts are made to tremble when we hear his blessed word.

### Verse 2

We recall his broken body as we look upon the bread; "give ye thanks divide and eat it in my memory," he said.

### Verse 3

And this crimson cup reminds us of that dread scene long ago, when He died in pain and anguish, there the blood was made to flow.

### Verse 4

There in agony He suffered on the cross for you and me; now upon the throne He's reigning, blessed lamb of calvary.

### Chorus

Thanks to God for such a savior now enthroned in heav'n above; thanks for this exalted favor, blest memorial of His love.
