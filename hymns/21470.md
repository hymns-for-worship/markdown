## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a sacred and hallowed retreat, Where my soul finds a fellowship sweet, Where the Lord of my life I may meet In the garden of my heart.
Â 

### Verse 2

There is naught can disturb or molest, There my spirit finds comfort and rest, And my soul is no longer distressed In the garden of my heart.


### Verse 3

Shut away from earth's strife and its din, And protected from soulstraining sin, For my Savior is dwelling within In the garden of my heart.

### Verse 4

There the dove of sweet peace always sings, And my faith ever trustingly clings; And the chime of sweet happiness rings In the garden of my heart.

### Chorus

In the cool of the day He walks with me, In the roseborded way He talks with me; In love's holy union, And sacred communion, In the garden of my heart.
