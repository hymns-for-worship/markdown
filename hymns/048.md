## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On Zion's glorious summit stood a numerous host redeemed by blood! They hymned their King in strains divine; I heard the song, and strove to join, I heard the song, and strove to join.

### Verse 2

Here all who suffered sword or flame for truth, or Jesus' lovely name, shout vict'ry now and hail the Lamb, and bow before the great I AM, and bow before the great I AM.

### Verse 3

While everlasting ages roll, eternal love shall feast their soul, and scenes of bliss, forever new, rise in succession to their view, rise in succession to their view.

### Sanctus

Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of hosts, on high adored! Who like me Thy praise should sing, O Almighty King! Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of hosts, on high adored! Holy, holy, holy.
