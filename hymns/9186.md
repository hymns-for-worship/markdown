## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a place over there filled with glory so bright, and my Savior is waiting in a land of no night; It's a land that is bathed in the Father's sweet love, And some day I will make it my home.

### Verse 2

In a dale by a hill, flow'rs will bloom there for me, as I rest 'neath the shade of a beautiful tree; Where the gentle breezes blow and the brook rushes by, And no storm-clouds ever darken the sky.

### Chorus

Well, He'll take me away on that wonderful day, And He'll lift all the burdens I bear. No today or tomorrow, no more pain, no more sorrow, Yes, I'll live in my home over there.
