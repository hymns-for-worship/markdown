## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have you any room for Jesus, He who bore your load of sin? As He knocks and asks admission, Sinner, will you let Him in?

### Verse 2

Room for pleasure, room for business But, for Christ the Crucified, Not a place that He can enter In the heart for which He died?

### Verse 3

Have you any room for Jesus, As in grace He calls again? O today is time accepted, Tomorrow you may call in vain.

### Verse 4

Room and time now give to Jesus, Soon will pass God's day of grace; Soon your heart left cold and silent, And your Savior's pleading cease.

### Chorus

Room for Jesus, King of glory! Hasten now, His word obey; Swing the heart's door widely open, Bid Him enter while you may.
