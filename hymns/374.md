# 374 - Ring Out The Message

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There's a message true and glad For the sinful and the sad, Ring it out, ring it out; It will give them courage new, It will help them to be true; Ring it out,

### Verse 2

 Tell the world of saving grace, Make it known in ev'ry place, Help the needy ones to know Him from whom all blessings flow;

### Verse 3

 Sin and doubt to sweep away, Till shall dawn the better day, Till the sinful world be won, For Jehovah's mighty Son; 

### Chorus

Ring out the word o'er land and sea,  Still far from Jesus many live in sin and doubt, Ring out the news that that makes men free, To all the lost of ev'ry nation Ring it out.
