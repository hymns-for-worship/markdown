# 311 - Why Not Now

## Notation

D - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

While we pray and while we plead, while you see your souls deep need, while your father calls you home, will you not, dear sinner come?

### Verse 2

You have wandered far away; do not risk another day, do not turn from God your face, but today accept his grace.

### Verse 3

Come to Christ, confession make; come to christ and pardon take; trust in him from day to day, he will keep you all the way.

### Chorus

Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?
