## Notation

D - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The hand that was nailed to the cross of woe, In love reaches down to the world below; 'Tis beckoning now to the souls that roam And pointing the way to the heav'nly home.

### Verse 2

E'en now I can see, thru a mist of tears That hand still out streched o'er a gulf of years, with healing and hope for my sin sick soul; One touch of its finger will make me whole.

### Verse 3

The hand that wro't wonders in days of old, Holds treasure more precious than gems of gold: The price of redemption from sin and shame, the gift of salvation thru Jesus' name.

### Chorus

The hand of my Savior I see, The hand that was wounded for me: "Twill lead me in love to the mansions above, The hand that was wounded for me!

### Verse 4

Triumphant thru grace I shall someday stand, With Jesus at home on that golden strand, His face in its beauty at last to see, My hand in the hand that was pierced for me.
