## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Gone is all my debt of sin, A great change is bro't within, And to live I now begin, Risen from the fall; Yet the debt I did not pay, Someone died for me one day, Sweeping all the debt away, Jesus paid it all. 

### Verse 2

 O I hope to please Him now, Light of joy is on my brow, As at His dear feet I bow, Safe within His love, Making His the debt I owed, Freedom true He has bestowed; So I'm singing on the road To my home above.

### Verse 3

 Sinner, not for me alone Did the Son of God atone; Your debt, too, He made His own, On the cruel tree. Come to Him with all your sin; Be as white as snow within; Full salvation you may win And rejoice with me.

### Chorus

Jesus died and paid it  On the cross of Calvary, And my heart was melted At His dying call, O His heart was broken On the tree for you and me, And the debt is canceled, Jesus paid it all.
