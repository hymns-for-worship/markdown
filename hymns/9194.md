## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father above, I bow at Your feet. I humbly come before Your holy seat. Gracious, O God, and great is Your fame. As day begins, I honor Your name.

### Verse 2

Give me today one soul I might save. Blessed be the church for which Christ's life He gave. Help me today, to do all Your will. And with Your Spirit all my heart fill.

### Verse 3

May I this day have that which I need. Never so much Your word I will not heed. All of my sins, forgive ev'ry one. May I repent and turn toward the Son.

### Verse 4

Bless those I love, the fam'ly You made. Help us to stand with love which never fades. Our country dear, bless each in his place; This nation strong before Your bright face.

### Coda

In Jesus' name I pray today! In Jesus name, Amen!
