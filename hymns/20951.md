## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I waited calmly for the Lord; He kindly heard my cry. He pulled me from the miry clay, The pit where I might die. He set my feet upon a rock, To firm the way I trod, And put a new song in my mouth, A song of praise to God.

### Verse 2

I sing that song before the Lord And bless His wondrous ways Because His mighty acts are such That I must offer praise. He formed creation with His Word And made the skies above. He works in faithfulness and truth And fills the earth with love.

### Verse 3

Some day, a pure and blameless host, Possessed by God alone, Will learn another song to sing Before His holy throne. I long to join that newer song And swell its mighty chords As one so purchased from the earth As firstfruits to the Lord.

### Coda

Alleluia! Amen. Amen.
