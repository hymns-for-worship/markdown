## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I traveled down a lonely road And no one seemed to care, The burden on my weary back Had bowed me to despair; I oft complained to Jesus How folks were treating me, And then I heard Him say so tenderly: "My feet were also weary, Upon the Calv'ry road; The cross became so heavy I fell beneath the load; Be faithful weary pilgrim, The morning I can see, Just lift your cross and follow close to Me." 

### Verse 2

 "I work so hard for Jesus" I often boast and say, "I've sacrificed a lot of things To walk the narrow way; I gave up fame and fortune; I'm worth a lot to Thee," And then I hear Him gently say to me: "I left the throne of glory And counted it but loss, My hands were nailed in anger Upon a cruel cross; But now we'll make the journey With your hand safe in Mine, So lift your cross and follow close to Me."

### Verse 3

 O, Jesus if I die upon A foreign field some day, 'Twould be no more than love demands; No less could I repay; "No greater love hath mortal man Than for a friend to die," These are the words He gently spoke to me: "If just a cup of water I place within your hand, Then just a cup of water Is all that I demand;" But if by death to living They can Thy glory see, I'll take my cross and follow close to Thee.
