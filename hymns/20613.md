## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The harvest call comes o'er the wave, I'll go, I'll go, And seek some struggling soul to save, I'll go, I'll go.

### Verse 2

The harvest calls, the fields are white, I'll go, I'll go, And labor there for God and right, I'll go, I'll go.

### Verse 3

Lost souls are wand'ring in the night, I'll go, I'll go, And strive to lead them to the light, I'll go, I'll go.

### Chorus

I'll go, and press the fight, Against the foe, I'll spread the gospel light, I'll go, I'll go.
