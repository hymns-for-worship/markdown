## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Onward, Christian soldiers! Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before; Christ, the royal Master, Leads against the foe; Forward into battle, See His banners go!

### Verse 2

 Crowns and thrones may perish, Kingdoms rise and wane, But the Church of Jesus Constant will remain; Gates of hell can never 'Gainst that Church prevail; We have Christ's own promise, And that cannot fail.

### Verse 3

 Onward, then, ye people, Join our happy throng; Blend with ours your voices In the triumph song; Glory, laud and honor Unto Christ the King, This thru countless ages Men and angels sing. 

### Chorus

Onward, Christian soldiers! Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.
