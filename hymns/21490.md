# 21490 - IT IS ENOUGH

## Notation

Eb - 9/8 on 7 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It is enough with His Word to comply, One word less would make it shy, If anything more we should supply, It would endanger our home on high.


### Verse 2

T'was enough for God to send His Son, On earth to die that holy One, He conquered death, a vict'ry won, Only His death would have done.

### Verse 3

'Tis so little He has asked you to do, Nothing it costs you to remain true, Our earthly life will soon be thru, Home He's prepared, then we shall view.


### Chorus

It is enough to do His command, If we be faithful we'll enter that land; A home not made by human hand, No earthly place could be so grand!
