## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I will be well when I leave the boat. I will be well tho' I cannot swim. I will be well when I touch His coat. I will be well when I go to Him.

### Verse 2

I will be well when I lose my wrath. I will be well even when I'm old. I will be well when I'm on His path. I will be well in the Shepherd's fold.

### Verse 3

I will be well when I am so ill. I will be well when I cannot see. I will be well when my body's still. I will be well for God walks with me.

### Chorus

I will be well in my Savior's love. I will be well here or heav'n above. I will be well for He's telling me, "You will be well, child, you walk with Me."
