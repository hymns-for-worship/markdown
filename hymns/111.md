# 111 - Clay In The Potter's Hand

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, you know my strength indeed is small, lest Thou should lead, I'm prone to slip and fall; guide and direct, o'er evil help me stand, make me as clay in the potter's hand.

### Verse 2

Thou art the potter, I am the clay, make of my life as pleases Thee each day; weave into beauty as You have it planned, make me as clay in the potter's hand.

### Verse 3

Father, we pray for power to be strong, let not our lives be marred by sin, and wrong; lead to Thy throne, by love take full command, make me as clay in the potter's hand.

### Chorus

Mold me, make me, as You'd have me be, take me, use me, that the lost may see; guard me, guide me, thru this pilgrim land, make me as clay, in the potter's hand.
