## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord is here! His promised word Is evermore the same, Himself to be where two or three Are gathered in His name.

### Verse 2

The Lord is here! Where Christ is come His Spirit too is there, With all who raise the song of praise Or breathe the voice of prayer.

### Verse 3

The Lord is here! He comes in peace With blessings from above, By pledge and sign of bread and wine To fold us in His love.

### Verse 4

The Lord is here! To every soul This gift of grace be giv'n, To walk the way of Christ today And share the life of heav'n.
