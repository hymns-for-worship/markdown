## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I love Thy kingdom, Lord, The house of Thine abode; The church our blest Redeemer saved With His own precious blood; I love Thy church, O God! Her walls before Thee stand, Dear as the apple of Thine eye, And graven on Thy hand.

### Verse 2

 For her my tears shall fall, For her my prayers ascend; To her my cries and toils be giv'n, Till toils and cares shall end; Beyond my highest joy I prize her heav'nly ways, Her sweet communion, solemn vows, Her hymns of love and praise.

### Verse 3

 Jesus, Thou Friend divine, Our Savior and our King! Thy hand from ev'ry snare and foe Shall great deliv'rance bring; Sure as Thy truth shall last, To Zion shall be giv'n The brightest glories earth can
