## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm just a weary pilgrim, Plodding thru this world of sin; Getting ready for that city When the saints go marching in.

### Verse 2

If I will see the Savior, A new life I must begin! Then I'll be in that glad number When the saints go marching in.

### Verse 3

I'll follow my Redeemer, In the steps where He has been; Thus I know that He will call me When the saints go marching in.

### Verse 4

Up there I'll see the Savior Who redeemed my soul from sin, With extended hands He'll greet me When the saints go marching in.

### Chorus

When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in; Lord, I want to be in that number, When the saints go marching in.
