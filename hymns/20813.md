# 20813 - ONLY ONE WAY

## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is only one way to the kingdom of God, 'Tis the oldfashioned way of the cross; You must come to the Savior, pass under the blood, You must count earthly pleasures as dross.

### Verse 2

There is only one way to the kingdom of God, You will find it is narrow and steep; Turn away from the one that is easy and broad, In the footsteps of Christ even keep.

### Verse 3

There is only one way to the kingdom of God, 'Tis the same for the great or the small; 'Tis the way of the cross and the sincleansing blood, 'Tis the way of the cross and the sincleasing blood, 'Tis the way of salvation for all.

### Verse 4

There is only one way to the kingdom of God, But it leads to the home of the soul; And the saved of all ages this pathway have trod, As they journeyed in faith to the goal.

### Chorus

There is only one way, 'tis the oldfasioned way, You will find it today, If you come to the cross, And are washed in the sincleansing blood.
