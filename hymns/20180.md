## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, the light of Your love is shining In the midst of the darkness shining; Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us, Set us free by the truth You now bring us. Shine on me, shine on me.

### Verse 2

Lord, I come to Your awesome presence From the shadows into Your radiance; By the blood I may enter Your brightness, Search me, try me, consume all my darkness.  Shine on me, shine on me.

### Verse 3

As we gaze on Your kingly brightness, So our faces display Your likeness; Ever changing from glory to glory, Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story. Shine on me, shine on me.

### Chorus

Shine, Jesus, shine, Fill this land with the Father's glory. Blaze, Spirit, blaze, Set our hearts on fire; Flow, river, flow, Flood the nations with grace and mercy, Send forth Your Word, Lord, and let there be light.
