## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a book which surpasses the sages, A volume of wisdom divine; And the glory that gleams from its pages, No splendor of earth can outshine.

### Verse 2

'Tis the light which will guide us to glory, The sword of the spirit of might; And to dwell on its beautiful story Is of heaven the sweetest delight.

### Verse 3

It reveals where a fountain is flowing, Which washes the soul from its stain. Age and sorrow are comforted, knowing With earth they shall part with all pain. 

### Chorus

Tis the Bible! The Bible! Our guiding star that leads from earth to heav'n. The Bible! The Bible! We love the precious Book of Truth which God has giv'n. 'Tis the bless-ed, bless-ed Bi-ble!
