### Verse 1

 I know the Lord will make a way for me, I know the Lord will make a way for me, When my way I cannot see, seems there is no hope for me, I know the Lord will make a way for me,

### Verse 2

  I know the Lord will make a way for me, I know the Lord will make a way for me,When the host of sin assail and I try and almost fail,

### Verse 3

 I know the Lord will make a way for me, I know the Lord will make a way for me, If I trust, believe, obey, let His holy word hold sway,
