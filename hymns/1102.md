## Notation

F - 4/2 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

And can it be that I should gain an int'rest in my Savior's blood? Died He for me, who caused His pain? For me, who scorned, His perfect love.

### Verse 2

You left Your father's throne above, so free, And infinite Your grace; Emptied Yourself of all but love, and bled for Adam's helpless race.

### Chorus

Amazing love, how can it be, that You, my God, would die for me. Amazing love, how can it be, that You, my God, would die for me.

### Verse 3

Boldly I come before Your throne, to claim Your mercy immense and free; No greater love will e'er be known, for O, my God, it found out me.
