## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Free from the law, o happy condition, Jesus hath bled, and there is remission; cursed by the law and bruised by the fall, grace hath redeemed us once for all.

### Verse 2

Now are we free, there's no condemnation, Jesus provides a perfect salvation; come unto me, o hear his sweet call, come unto Jesus once for all.

### Verse 3

Children of God o glorious calling, truly his grace will help us from falling; passing from death to life at his call, blessed salvation once for all.

### Chorus

Once for all, o sinner receive it; once for all, o won't you believe it; cling to the savior, obey his call, christ hath redeemed us once for all.
