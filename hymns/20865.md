## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You hear me when I call. You are my morning song. Tho' darkness fills the night, it can not hide the light. Whom shall I fear? You crush the enemy underneath my feet. You are my sword and shield, tho' troubles linger still. Whom shall I fear? I know Who goes before me. I know Who stands behind: The God of angel armies is always by my side.  The One Who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine. The God of angel armies is always by my side. And nothing formed against me shall stand! You hold the whole world in Your hands. I'm holding onto Your promises. You are faithful. I know Who goes before me, I know Who stands behind: The God of angel armies is always by my side!
