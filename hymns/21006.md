## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A certain man of whom we read Who lived in days of old, Tho' he was rich he felt his need Of something more than gold.

### Verse 2

It happened on a certain day This little man was told That Jesus soon would pass that way With something more than gold.

### Verse 3

He climbed a tree above the crowd So that he might behold The blessed One with power to give something more than gold.

### Verse 4

The Savior came along the way, And saw him in the tree, Then calling to him Jesus said: "I must abide with thee!"

### Chorus

O yes, my friend, there's something more, Something more than gold; To know your sins are all forgiv'n Is something more than gold; O yes, my friend, there's something more, There's something more than gold; To know your sins are all forgiv'n Is something more than gold.

### Verse 5

So he obeyed, and soon he found The half had not been told, The blessed Jesus broâ€™t to him Was better far than gold.
