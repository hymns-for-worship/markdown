## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father of mercies, day by day my love to Thee grows more and more; Thy gifts are strewn up my way like sands upon the great seashore, like sands upon the great seashore.

### Verse 2

Father of mercies, God of love, whose gentle gifts all creatures share, the rolling seasons as they move proclaim to all Thy constant care, proclaim to all Thy constant care.

### Verse 3

Father of mercies, may our hearts ne'er overlook Thy bounteous care; but what our Father's hand imparts still own in grateful praise and prayer, still own in grateful praise and prayer.
