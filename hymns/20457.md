## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Softly now the light of day Fades upon our sight away; Free from care, from labor free, Lord we would commune with Thee!

### Verse 2

Thou whose all pervading eye Naught escapes, without, within, Pardon each informity, Open fault and secret sin!

### Verse 3

Soon for us the light of day Shall forever pass away; Then from sin and sorrow free, Take us, Lord to dwell with Thee!
