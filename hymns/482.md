## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I am weak but Thou art strong, Jesus, keep me from all wrong; I'll be satisfied as long As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.

### Verse 2

 Thru this world of toil and snares, If I falter, Lord, who cares? Who with me my burden shares? None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

### Verse 3

  When my feeble life is o'er, Time for me will be no more, Guide me gently, safely o'er To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

### Chorus

Just a closer walk with Thee, Grant it, Jesus, is my plea; Daily walking close to Thee, Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
