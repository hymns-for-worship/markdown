## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, speak to me that I may speak In living echoes of Thy tone; As Thou has sought, so let me seek Thine erring children, lost and lone.

### Verse 2

O strengthen me, that while I stand Firm on the Rock and strong in Thee, I may stretch out a loving hand To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

### Verse 3

O teach me, Lord, that I may teach The precious things Thou dost impart; And wing my words that they may reach The hidden depths of many a heart.

### Verse 4

O fill me with Thy fullness, Lord, Until my very heart o'erflow; In kindling tho't and glowing word, Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.
