## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've seen the lightning flashing And heard the thunder roll, I've felt sin's breakers dashing, Which tried to conquer my soul; I've heard the voice of my Savior, He bid me still fight on He promised never to leave me, Never to leave me alone.

### Verse 2

The world's fierce winds are blowing, Temptation's sharp and keen; I have a peace in knowing My Savior stands between; He stands to shield me from danger When all my friends are gone He promised never to leave me, Never to leave me alone.

### Verse 3

He died on Calv'ry's mountain, For me they pierced His side, For me He opened that fountain, The crimson, cleansing tide; For me He's waiting in glory Upon His heav'nly throne He promised never to leave me, Never to leave me alone.

### Chorus

No, never alone, No, never alone He promised never to leave me, Never to leave me alone; No, never alone, No, never alone He promised never to leave me, Never to leave me alone.
