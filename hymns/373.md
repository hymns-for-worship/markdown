## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Hold Thou my hand, so weak I am and helpless, I dare not take one step without Thine aid; Hold Thou my hand, for then, O loving Savior, No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid. 

### Verse 2

 Hold Thou my hand, and closer, closer draw me To Thy dear self, my hope, my joy, my all; Hold Thou my hand, lest haply I should wander, And missing Thee, my trembling feet shall fall.

### Verse 3

 Hold Thou my hand, that when I reach the margin Of that lone river Thou didst cross for me; A heav'nly light may flash along its waters And ev'ry wave like crystal bright shall be. 

### Coda

Amen.
