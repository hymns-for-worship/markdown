## Lyrics

### Verse 1

See! The Monarch of monarchs come in majesty! Let us bow down and worship Him who doeth all things well; He leads the nations out of sin and causes foes to flee:

### Verse 2

Like the waves of the ocean rolls His praise today, for His wonderful love has helped so many to excel; he sends the captives, free from chains, all singing on their way:

### Verse 3

O the joy that will thrill us some day on high, when we see Him in glory, where celestial praises swell; where cheubim and seraphim now join us when we cry:

### Chorus

All hail our King Immanuel! O honor His name forever what His grace has done; His mighty love in ev'ry heart should dwell, for He is the world's Redeemer, Jehovah's only Son! All hail, our King Immanuel!
