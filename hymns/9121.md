## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beyond the clouds by faith we see Our heav'nly home eternally. Thru mist of time we slowly trod To live forever there with God.

### Verse 2

Let us rejoice when we look back To see the saints that made the trek, And know that we can do that too Because Christ died for me and you.

### Verse 3

By faith the things we cannot see Some day will be reality. Around the throne to sing His praise For endless years and endless days.

### Coda

Oh praise His name, Christ is our King! He reigns in heav'n O'er ev'rything. O praise His name, Christ is our King! He is our King! Christ is our King!
