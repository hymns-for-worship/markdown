## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I am safe, whatever may betide me; I am safe whoever may deride me; I am safe, as long as I confide me In the hollow of God's hand.

### Verse 2

 What tho' fierce the storm blast roar around me; What tho' sore life's trials oft confound me; I am safe, for naught of ill can harm me In the hollow of God's hand.

### Verse 3

 Everlasting arms of love enfold me; Words of peace the voice divine has told me; I am safe, while God Himself doth hold me In the hollow of God's hand. 

### Chorus

In the blessed hollow of His hand, In the blessed hollow of His hand; I am safe while God Himself doth hold me In the hollow of His hand.
