### Verse 1

We shall assemble on the mountain, We shall assemble at the throne; With humble hearts into His presence, We bring an offering of song.

### Verse 2

And at the end of our journey, We shall bow down on bended knee; And with the angels up in heaven, We'll sing the song of victory.

### Chorus

Glory and honor and dominion unto the Lamb, unto the King, O, hallelujah, hallelujah! We sing the song of the redeemed.
