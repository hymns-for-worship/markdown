## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've found a Friend, O such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him; He drew me with the cords of love, And thus He bound me to Him. And round my heart still closely twine Those ties which naught can sever, For I am His, and He is mine, Forever and forever.

### Verse 2

I've found a Friend, O such a Friend! He bled, He died to save me; And not alone the gift of life, But His own self  He gave me. Naught that I have my own I call, I hold it for 

### Verse 3

I've found a Friend, O such a Friend! So kind, and true, and tender, So wise a Counselor and Guide, So mighty a Defender! From Him who loves me now so well, What pow'r my soul can sever? Shall life or death, or earth or hell? No; I am His forever.
