## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You are the sunshine and I am the candle, You are the mountain and I am a hill; You are the ocean and I am a river, winding and swirling and never quite still, winding and swirling and never quite still. You are the canyon and I am a crevice, You are the heavens and I am a star; You are the thunder and I am a whisper, quietly longing to be where You are, quietly longing to be where You are. 

### Coda

You are so mighty and worthy of praise, You are so mighty and worthy of praise, worthy of praise.
