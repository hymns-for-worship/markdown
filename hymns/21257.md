## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He took my place upon the cross of calv'ry, Upon that hill, He bore my sin in shame; Nailed to a cross, my Jesus showed He loves me: My Savior died, I know that I'm to blame, My Savior died, I know that I'm to blame.

### Verse 2

He took my place, the angry mob they found Him, They tore His hands and feet and pierced His side; My Savior's blood poured freely down around Him: He cried, "My God, why have You turned aside?" He cried, "My God, why have You turned aside?"

### Verse 3

He took my place, my sins can be forgiven, Because He died, I live in hope each day; I love God's Son, who reigns above in Heaven: My Jesus Christ, with You I long to stay, My Jesus Christ, with You I long to stay.
