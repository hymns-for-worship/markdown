## Notation

G - 4/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm not ashamed to own my Lord, Nor to defend His cause, Maintain the honor of His word, The glory of His cross.

### Verse 2

His consecrated cross I'll bear Till death shall set me free, And then go home, my crown to wear; For there's a crown for me.

### Verse 3

I know not when my Lord may comeâ€” At night or noonday fair, Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him Or "meet Him in the air."

### Verse 4

I know that over yonder stands A place prepared for me, A home, "a house not made with hands," Most wonderful to see.

### Verse 5

Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely follow me, And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be.


### Verse 6

There I shall bathe my weary soul In seas of heav'nly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll, Across my peaceful breast.
