## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What child is this who, laid to rest On Mary's lap, is sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ the King, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; Haste, haste, to bring Him laud, The babe, the son of Mary.

### Verse 2

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, Come peasant, king, to own Him. The King of kings salvation brings; Let loving hearts enthrone Him. Raise, raise a song on high; The virgin sings her lullaby. Joy, Joy, for Christ is born, The babe, the son of Mary.
