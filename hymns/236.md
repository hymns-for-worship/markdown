## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have heard of a land on a far away strand, in the Bible the story is told; where cares never come, never darkness nor gloom, and nothing shall ever grow old.

### Verse 2

There are evergreen trees that bend low in the breeze, and their fruitage is brighter than gold; there the throne of God stands, in that fairest of lands, and nothing shall ever grow old.

### Verse 3

There's a home in that land, at the Father's right hand, there are mansions whose joys are untold; and perrenial spring, where the saints ever sing, and nothing shall ever grow old.

### Chorus

In that beautiful land, on the far away strand, no storms with their blasts ever frown; the street, I am told, is paved with pure gold, and the sun, it shall never go down.
