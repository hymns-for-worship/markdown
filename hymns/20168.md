Come, O King, with the scepter of Your righteousness. Come, O King, robed in splendor of Your holiness. Mighty in strength, Mighty in pow'r, come and reign o'er ev'ry heart. Gird Your Sword! Mighty God! For the truth ride on in glor'ous victory. Come and reign, in my heart. And in truth, ride on in victory. Mighty God, Prince of Peace, Ruler of all kingdoms.
