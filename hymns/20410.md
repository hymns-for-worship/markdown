## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O my heart sings today, sings for joy and gladness, Jesus saves, satisfies, takes away my sadness. Guilt is gone; Peace is mine, peace like to a river. Jesus is wonderful, mighty to deliver.

### Verse 2

Once a slave, now I'm free, free from condemnation. Jesus gives liberty and a full salvation. Now the sins of the past have been all forgiven, and my name is inscribed in the book of heaven.

### Verse 3

Living here with my Lord in a holy union, day by day, all the way, holding sweet communion. O what change grace hath wrought in my lowly station, since my soul has received full and free salvation!

### Chorus

Wonderful, Jesus to me! Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He, Saving me keeping me from all sin and shame.
