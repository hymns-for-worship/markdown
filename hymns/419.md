## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amid the trials which I meet, Amid the thorns which pierce my feet, One thought remains supremely sweet, Thou thinkest, Lord, of me! 

### Verse 2

 The cares of life come thronging fast, Upon my soul their shadow cast; Their gloom reminds my heart at last, Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

### Verse 3

 Let shadows come, let shadows go, Let life be bright or dark with woe, I am content, for this I know, Thou thinkest, Lord, of me! 

### Chorus

Thou thinkest, Lord, of me, (of me,) Thou thinkest, Lord, of me, (of me,) What need I fear when Thou art near And thinkest, Lord, of me.
