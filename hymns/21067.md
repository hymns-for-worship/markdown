## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Â Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh, When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee; Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight, Dawns the sweet conciousness, I am with Thee.

### Verse 2

Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows, The solemn hush of nature newly born; Alone with Thee in breathless adoration, In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

### Verse 3

When sinks the soul, subdued by toil to slumber, Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer; Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'er shading, But sweeter still, to wake and find Thee there.

### Verse 4

So shall it be at last, in that bright morning When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee; O, in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning, Shall rise the glorious tho't I am with Thee.
