## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once in royal David's city Stood a lowly cattle shed, Where a mother laid her Baby In a manger for His bed; Mary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ her little Child.

### Verse 2

He came down to earth from heaven, Who is God and Lord of all, And His shelter was a stable And His cradle was a stall; With the poor, and mean, and lowly, Lived on earth our Savior holy.

### Verse 3

And, thru all His wondrous childhood, He would honor, and obey, Love, and watch the lowly maiden In whose gentle arms He lay; Christian children all must be Mild, obedient, good as He.

### Verse 4

For He is our childhood's pattern, Day by day like us He grew; He was little, weak, and helpless, Tears and smiles like us He knew; And He feeleth for our sadness; And He shareth in our gladness.

### Verse 5

And our eyes at last shall see Him, Thru His own redeeming love; For that Child so dear and gentle Is our Lord in heav'n above; And He leads His children on To the place where He is gone.

### Verse 6

Not in that poor lowly stable; With the oxen standing by, We shall see Him, but in heaven, Set at God's right hand on high; When like stars His children crowned, All in white shall wait around. Amen.
