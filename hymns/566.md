## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 It may be at morn, when the day is awaking, When sunlight thru darkness and shadow is breaking, That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory, To receive from the world His own. 

### Verse 2

 It may be at midday, it may be at twilight, It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory, When Jesus receives His own.  

### Verse 3

 O joy! O delight! should we go without dying, No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying, Caught up thru the clouds with our Lord into glory, When Jesus receives His own.

### Chorus

O Lord Jesus,  how long, how long ere we shout the glad song, Christ returneth! Hallelujah! hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.
