## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hark! The voice of Jesus calling: "Who will go and work today? Fields are white, the harvest waiting Who will bear the sheaves away?"

### Verse 2

While the souls of men are dying, And the Master calls for you, Let none hear you idly saying, "There is nothing I can do."

### Verse 3

If you cannot speak like angels, If you cannot preach like Paul, You can tell the love of Jesus, You can say, "He died for all."

### Verse 4

Gladly take the task He gives you; Let His work your pleasure be; Answer quickly when He calleth, "Here am I; O Lord, send me."
