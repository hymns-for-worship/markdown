# 084 - Tarry With Me

## Notation

Eb - 9/8 on 7 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tarry with me, o my Savior, for the day is passing by; see the shades of evening gather, and the night is drawing nigh.

### Verse 2

Deeper, deeper grow my shadows, paler now the glowing west; swift the night of death advances: shall it be the night of rest?

### Verse 3

Tarry with me, o my Savior; lay my head upon Thy breast till the morning; then awake me, morning of eternal rest.

### Chorus

Tarry with me, blessed Savior; leave me not till morning light; for I'm lonely here without Thee: tarry with me thru the night.
