## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thou, whose almighty Word Chaos and darkness heard, And took their flight, Hear us, we humbly pray, And where the gospel day Sheds not its glorious ray, Let there be light!

### Verse 2

Thou who didst come to bring, On Thy redeeming wing, Healing and sight, Health to the sick in mind, Sight to the inly blind O now to all mankind Let there be light!

### Verse 3

If just a cup of cool refreshing water Is all that I have to give my fellow man, Then let me see no one is ever thirsty. With what I have I will do the most I can.
