# 115 - In The Desert Of Sorrow And Sin

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the desert of sorrow and sin, Lo! I faint as I journey along; with the warfare without and within, see my strength and my hope nearly gone.

### Verse 2

In my weakness I turn to the fount, from the Rock that was smitten for me; and I drink, and I joyfully count all my trials a blessing to be.

### Verse 3

O Thou God of comassion, I pray, let me ever abide in Thy sight; let me drink of the fount day by day, till I join Thee in mansions of light.

### Chorus

I thirst, let me drink, of the life giving stream let me drink; tis the Rock, cleft for me, tis the water, the water of life.
