## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My sins, O Lord, they are so many; Their guilt before me ever stands. Yes, my tears flow daily like a river. Shall I ever see the promised land?

### Verse 2

Our God looked down on His creation. He knew my sin and agony. By His grace He planned for me redemption; Framed a way from sin to set man free.

### Verse 3

God's grace for me is all sufficient, My Savior went to Calvary. On the cross He suffered pain and anguish; Paved the way by blood for you and me.
