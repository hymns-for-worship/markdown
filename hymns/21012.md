## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Some day the silver cord will break, And I no more as now shall sing; But O, the joy when I shall wake Within the palace of the King!

### Verse 2

Some day my earthly house will fall, I cannot tell how soon 'twill be; But this I know, my All in All Has now a place in heav'n for me.

### Verse 3

Some day when fades the golden sun Beneath the rosytinted west, My blessed Lord will say, "Well done!" And I shall enter into rest.

### Verse 4

Some day till then I'll watch and wait, My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, That when my Savior ope's the gate, My soul to Him may take its flight.

### Chorus

And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story Saved by grace.
