## Notation

G - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In sorrow I wandered, my spirit opprest, But now I am happy— securely I rest; From morning till evening glad carols I sing, And this is the reason; I walk with the King. 

### Verse 2

 For years in the fetters of sin I was bound, The world could not help me, no comfort I found; But now like the birds and the sunbeams of spring, I'm free and rejoicing— I walk with the King.

### Verse 3

 O soul near despair in the lowlands of strife, Look up and let Jesus come into your life; The joy of salvation to you He would bring, Come into the sunlight and walk with the King. 

### Chorus

I walk with the King, hallelujah! I walk with the King, praise His name! No longer I roam my soul faces home, I walk and I talk with the King.
