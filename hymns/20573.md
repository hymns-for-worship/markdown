### Verse 1

There was a little boy, David, Down by the babblin' brook. There was s little boy, David, Five little stones he took. One little stone went in the sling; The sling went 'round and 'round. One little stone went in the sling; The sling went 'round and 'round, 'round and around and around and around, 'round and around and around. One little stone went up in the air and the Giant came tumbling down. BOOM!
