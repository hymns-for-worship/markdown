## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O the yesterday's moments for pleasure or woe, Have been stealthily carried away; I am nearer the valley of shadows, I know Am I nearer to heaven today?

### Verse 2

I am nearer the time for the breaking of ties, That are holding my loved ones to me; I am nearer the time for my latest goodbyes Am I nearer, O Father to Thee?

### Verse 3

I am nearer the close of my labor below, I am nearer the end of my way; I am nearer the edge of the valley, I know Am I nearer to heaven today?

### Chorus

Am I nearer? Am I nearer? Am I nearer to heaven today? Am I nearer the gate where the blessed ones wait? Am I nearer to heaven today?
