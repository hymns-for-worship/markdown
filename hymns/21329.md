## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Twas there on the mountain and high 'bove the sea, They waited where Je-sus had asked them to be; To hear the commission that Jesus would bring, Commission Almighty, Revealed by the King. 

### Verse 2

All pow'r, sayeth Jesus is given to Me, In heaven, on earth and beyond ev'ry sea, Go tell ev'ry people, For me they should live, And carefully follow, The way that I give. 

### Verse 3

Go shout from the mountains, The Savior is slain, Say ye, He has risen, He's coming again! And lo, I Am with you, And ever shall be, And always you'll teach in The name of the Three. 

### Coda

Hold high thou the banner of truth to the world, The winds of the Spirit will keep it unfurled.
