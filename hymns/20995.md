## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On the other side of Jordan there our loved ones we shall meet; It will be a glad reunion when we sit at Jesus' feet. On the other side of Jordan where no tears will e'er be known. On the other side of Jordan we'll be home.

### Verse 2

On the other side of Jordan when we see the Savior's face, We will praise the One who made us and give thanks for saving grace. On the other side of Jordan there His glory will be shown. On the other side of Jordan we'll be home.

### Verse 3

On the other side of Jordan 'tis a land beyond compare; And the Father, Son and Spirit wait with welcome arms up there. On the other side of Jordan never more the need to roam. On the other side of Jordan we'll be home.

### Chorus

On the other side of Jordan we shall dwell forever more; With the saints and the redeemed ones over on the golden shore. On the other side of Jordan heaven waits across the foam. On the other side of Jordan we'll be home.
