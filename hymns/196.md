## Notation

G - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We read of a place thatâ€™s called heaven, it's made for the pure and the free; these truths of God's word He has given, how beautiful heaven must be.

### Verse 2

In heaven no drooping nor pining, nor wishing for else where to be; God's light is forever there shining, how beautiful heaven must be.

### Verse 3

The angels so sweetly are singing, up there by the beautiful sea; the song of redemption is ringing, how beautiful heaven must be.

### Chorus

How beautiful heaven must be, sweet home of the happy and free; fair haven of rest for the weary, how beautiful heaven must be.
