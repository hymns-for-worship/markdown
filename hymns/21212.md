## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Father, whate'er of earthly bliss Thy sov'reign will denies, Accepted at Thy throne of grace, Let this petition rise.

### Verse 2

Give me a calm, a thankful heart, From ev'ry murmur free; The blessings of Thy grace impart, And let me live to Thee.

### Verse 3

Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine My life and death attend, Thy presence thru my journey shine, And crown my journey's end.

### Coda

Amen.
