## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Oft I dream of an evergreen valley, hidden deep in God's heaven above Where the Savior is waiting to welcome the redeemed to that haven of love.


### Verse 2

O, 'tis said there's no sickness nor dying, no more pain there to darken the day, Happy hearts never broken by sorrow, no more tears to burden the way.

### Verse 3

I have heard there's no sin in that valley, naught but peace and eternal sweet bliss; And I'm trusting my Savior to keep me ere the joys of that valley I miss.

### Verse 4

Soon I'll go to that evergreen valley, where I'll rest 'neath the evergreen trees. I can bask in its wonderful beauty, and forever happy I'll be.

### Chorus

I've heard pretty flowers are blooming, sparkling dew robes their beauty so rare; And I'm told it will always be springtime in that land where there's never a care.
