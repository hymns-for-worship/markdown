### Verse 1

 Blessed are they who do His commandments, They shall claim the tree of life; Into the city they shall enter, They are victors in the strife.

### Verse 2

 Blessed are they who do His commandments, They shall wear the robes of white; Under the portals God shall lead them, They shall serve Him day and night.


### Verse 3

 Blessed are they who do His commandments, They shall stand before the throne; Into the life of joy eternal, God shall claim them for His own. 

### Chorus

Blessed, blessed, blessed are they; Into the city they shall enter, Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.
