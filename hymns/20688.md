## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet, God leads His dear children along; Where the water's cool flow bathed the weary one's feet, God leads His dear children along.

### Verse 3

Tho sorrows befall us and evils oppose, God leads His dear children along; Thru grace we can conquer defeat all our foes, God leads His dear children along.

### Verse 4

Away from the mire, and away from the clay, God leads His dear children along; Away up in glory, eternity's day, God leads His dear children along.

### Chorus

Some thru the waters, some thru the flood, Some thru the fire, but all thru the blood;

### Coda

Some thru great sorrows, but God gives a song, In the night season and all the day long.

### Verse 2

Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright, God leads His dear children along; Sometimes in the valley, in the darkest of night, God leads His dear children home.
