## Notation

C - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amazing grace, O how sweet the sound That saved a poor sinner like me! Tho' once I was lost, yet now I'm found; Tho' I was blinded now I see!

### Verse 2

Thru disappointment and danger, too, Thru labors and sorrows we've come! But God's grace has guided safely thru, And it will surely lead us home!

### Verse 3

Then with the ransomed around God's throne, We'll praise our Redeemer and King! We'll tell how His mercy for sin did atone; Thru countless ages this song we'll sing!

### Chorus

And it's all because of God's amazing grace!  Because on Calv'ry's mountain He took my place! And some day, some glorious morning, I shall see Him face to face, All because of God's amazing grace
