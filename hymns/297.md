# 297 - Prepare To Meet Thy God

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Careless soul, why will you linger, wandering from the throne of God, hear you now, the invitation? O prepare to meet thy God.

### Verse 2

Why so thoughtless are you standing, while the fleeting years go by, and your life is spent in folly? O prepare to meet thy God.

### Verse 3

If you spurn the invitation till the spirit shall depart, then you'll see your sad condition, unprepared to meet thy God.

### Chorus

Careless soul, o heed the warning, for your life will soon be gone, o how sad to meet the judgement, unprepared to meet thy God.
