### Verse 1

Complete in Christ! O! joy within That I am cleansed from all my sin, And I, so heedless, proud, and flawed, Am now perfected in my God! "Complete in Christ!" With heart and mind Forgetting all that lies behind, I seek the prize that waits ahead: The resurrection from the dead.

### Verse 2

Complete in Christ! By grace, complete! My hope sustains me thru defeat. I shout amid the tempter's lies, "Though I have fallen,  I will rise!" "Complete in Christ! Lord, send the day! This earthly tent shall pass away, And I shall know the Sacrificed, Presented then, complete in Christ.

### Chorus

Complete in Christ! "Alive with Him!" Abundantly, exceedingly, Complete, ever in Christ! Complete and perfected in Christ who transforms me; Alive and united with Him who forgives me, ever in Christ!
