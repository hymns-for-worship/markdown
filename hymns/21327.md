## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What is that, O Majesty, Ringing clearly high up there; Do the angels praise and glorify their Lord? Do the wond'rous glad hosannas sound thru heaven's Holy realm, When a child is born to Thee, O Living Word? 

### Verse 2

Listen well. O Majesty, While we praise Thee here below; As we tell Thee of the joy within our soul.  Tho' our songs be not as pretty  as the songs the angels sing, When a child is given place within Thy fold.

### Verse 3

And we praise Thee, Holy Lord, For this child born just today; For this one who came not doubting Thy great love. For this one who came believing truly that Messiah lives, Doubting not our Lord is reigning high above.
