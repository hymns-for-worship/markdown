## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Work, for the night is coming, Work thru the morning hours; Work while the dew is sparkling, Work 'mid springing flow'rs. Work when the day grows brighter, Work in the glowing sun; Work, for the night is coming, When man's work is done. 

### Verse 2

 Work, for the night is coming, Work thru the sunny noon; Fill brightest hours with labor, Rest comes sure and soon. Give ev'ry flying minute, Something to keep in store; Work, for the night is coming, When man works no more. 

### Verse 3

 Work, for the night is coming, Under the sunset skies; While their bright tints are glowing, Work, for daylight flies. Work till the last beam fadeth, Fadeth to shine no more; Work, while the night is dark'ning, When man's work is o'er.
