## Lyrics

### Verse 1

More love to Thee, o Christ, more love to Thee! Hear Thou the prayer I make on bended knee; this is my earnest plea, more love, o Christ to Thee, more love to Thee! More love to Thee.

### Verse 2

Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest; now Thee alone I seek, give what is best; this all my prayer shall be, more love, o Christ, to Thee, more love to Thee! More love to Thee.

### Verse 3

Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise; This be the parting cry my heart shall raise, this still my prayer shall be, more love, o Christ, to Thee, more love to Thee! More love to Thee.
