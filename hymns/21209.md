## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All praise to Him who reigns above, In majesty supreme; Who gave His Son for man to die, That He might man redeem.

### Verse 2

His name above all names shall stand, Exalted more and more, At God the Father's own right hand Where angel hosts adore.

### Verse 3

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man Once ruined by the fall; Thou hast devised salvation's plan, For Thou hast died for all.

### Verse 4

His name shall be the Counselor, The mighty Prince of Peace, Of all earthâ€™s kingdoms conqueror, Whose reign shall never cease! 

### Chorus

Blessed be the name, blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord: Blessed be the name, blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
