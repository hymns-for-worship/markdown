## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I see he raging ocean and the surging waves engulf me, When I lose all earthly treasure, and I tremble at their pow'r, When disease and trauma rush me pain and suff'ring is my bower, Then I trust in You my Father, and my faith grows strong in You.

### Verse 2

When my loved ones all have left me, waves of sadness then enfold me, When I'm hated, hurt and hungry and I tremble at their pow'r; When I suffer persecution, when afflicted and devoured, Then I see Your pow'r is greater and my faith becomes my all.

### Chorus

And I say Nothing, O nothing can separate me from the love God. Nothing, O nothing can separate Him from His care for me. Neither death nor life, no principalities, Neither sword nor famine, All who disagree O nothing, Absolutly nothing! Can separate me from the love of God.
