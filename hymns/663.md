## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Soon this life will all be over, And our pilgrimage will end, Soon we'll take our heav'nly journey, Be at home with Christ our friend; Heaven's gates are standing open, Waiting for our entrance there, Some sweet day we're going over, All the beauties there to share.

### Verse 2

 Soon we'll see the light of morning, Then the new day will begin, Soon we'll hear the Father calling, "Come, my children, enter in;" Then we'll hear a choir of angels, Singing out the vict'ry song, All our troubles will be ended And we'll live with heaven's throng.

### Verse 3

 Soon we'll meet all the redeemed ones, And we'll take them by the hand, Soon we'll press them to our bossom, Over in the promised land; Then we'll be at home forever, Thruout all eternity, What a blessed, blessed morning That eternal morn will be!

### Chorus

Just a little while to stay here, Just a little while to wait, Just a little while to labor In the path that's always straight and narrow, Just a little more of trouble In this low and sinful state; Then we'll enter heaven's portals, Sweeping thru the pearly gates.
