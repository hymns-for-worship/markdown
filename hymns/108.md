## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Savior, Thy dying love Thou gavest me, nor should I aught withhold, Dear Lord, from Thee: in love my soul would bow, my heart fulfill its vow, some off'ring bring Thee now, something for Thee.

### Verse 2

Give me a faithful heart likeness to Thee that each departing day henceforth may see some work of love begun, some deed of kindness done, some wand'rer sought and won, something for Thee.

### Verse 3

All that I am and have Thy gifts so free in joy, in grief, thru life, Dear Lord, for Thee! And when Thy face I see, my randsomed soul shall be, thru all eternity, something for Thee.
