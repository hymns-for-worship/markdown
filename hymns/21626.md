## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"Greater is He who is in you, Than he who is in the world," Greater the treasure within you, Than any diamond or pearl. Richer the soul and stronger the heart, Grander the ending of life than the start. Greater is He who is in you.



### Verse 2

Greater the love of the Father, Deeper the love of the Son, Dying for those who despised Him, Jesus, the Crucified One. Bearing our sins and paying the price; Justice required, a pure sacrifice. Greater is He who is in you.


### Verse 3

Greater the hope of salvation, Living in heavenly light. Walking in daily devotion, Seeking to do what is right. Clearer the conscience, cleaner the soul; Higher the purpose and nobler the goal. Greater is He who is in you!
