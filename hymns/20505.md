## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I only takes a spark to get a fire going, And soon all those around can warm up in its glowing. That's how it is with God's love; Once you've experienced it, You spread His love to ev'ryone; You want to pass it on.

### Verse 2

What a wondrous time is spring when all the trees are budding, The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming; That's how it is with God's love; Once you've experienced it, You want to sing, it's fresh like spring, You want to pass it on.

### Verse 3

I wish for you, my friends, this happiness that I've found, You can depend on Him, It matters not where you're bound; I'll shout it from the mountain top, I want my world to know; The Lord of love has come to me, I want to pass it on.
