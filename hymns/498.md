## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Sweet are the promises, Kind is the word; Dearer far than any message man ever heard; Pure was the mind of Christ, Sinless I see; He the great example is, and pattern for me. 

### Verse 2

 Sweet is the tender love Jesus has shown, Sweeter far than any love that mortals have known; Kind to the erring one, Faithful is He; He the great example is, and pattern for me.

### Verse 3

 List to His loving words, "Come unto Me!" Weary, heavyladen, there is sweet rest for thee; Trust in His promises, Faithful and sure; Lean upon the Savior, and thy soul is secure.

### Chorus

Where He leads I'll follow Follow all the way. Where He leads I'll follow Follow Jesus ev'ry  day.
