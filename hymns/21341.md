O come and sing unto the LORD; To Him our voices raise. Let us in our most joyful songs The LORD, our Savior praise.

Before His presence let us come With praise and thankful voice; Let us sing joyful psalms to Him, With grateful hearts rejoice.

The LORD our God is King of kings, Above all gods His throne; The depths of earth are in His hand; The mountains are His own.
