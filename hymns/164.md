## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O the depth and the riches of God's saving grace flowing down from the cross for me! There the debt for my sins by the savior was paid in his suffering on calvary!

### Verse 2

How my heart humbly bows in his presence today, when I think of His agony; by His stripes I am freed from the bondage of sin thru his suffereing on calvary!

### Verse 3

O what marvelous mercy, what infinite love, what immeasurable grace I see! By His blood I am cleansed, I am happy and free thru His suffering on calvary!

### Chorus

O the riches and depth of such wonderful love, flowing boundless and full and free! And the debt on the cross for my sins was all paid in His suffering on calvary!
