### Verse 1

Now is the time to seek and find Those things that mean most of all, Tomorrow might be a little too late For you to respond to the call.

The truth is written for all mankind, That he might hear, believe, and obey. In this, there is eternal life Why wait another day?

Just open your heart and let God in, Thru Jesus Christ you are saved from sin. Obey His commands and you will see, It is as He promised, you shall be free.

Now is the time.
