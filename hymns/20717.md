### Verse 1

Do you know Saul, David and Solomon? Do you know Saul, David and Solomon? Do you know Saul, David and Solomon? They were the first three kings of Israel. The first was Saul, a tall and handsome young man. He looked the part and ev'ryone thought he was grand. But he did not obey his God anymore and he went crazy falling down on his sword.

### Verse 2

King David was a man after God's own heart. His faith and courage really set him apart. He loved to sing God's praise and play on his harp. God promised him his throne would never depart.

### Verse 3

Then Solomon the son of King David, the wisest, richest king that ever had lived. He built the temple so they could worship God, but when he died the kingdom fell apart.
