### Verse 1

All things praise Thee, Lord most high. Heav'n and earth, and sea and sky; All were for Thy glory made, That Thy greatness, thus displayed, Should all worshp bring to Thee; All things praise Thee, Lord, may we!

### Verse 2

All things praise Thee, night to night Snigs in silent hymns of light; All things praise Thee, day by day Chants Thy pow'r in burning ray; Time and space are praising Thee; All things praise Thee, Lord, may we!

### Verse 3

All things praise Thee: heav'n's high shrine Rings with melody divine; Lowly bending at They feet, Seraph and archangel meet; This their highest bliss, to be Ever raising, Lord, may we!
