## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my soul is singing in that promised land above, I'll be satisfied; Praising Christ the Savior for redeeming grace and love, I'll be satisfied.

### Verse 2

Living in a city where the soul shall never die, I'll be satisfied; There to meet with saved ones, nevermore to say goodby, I'll be satisfied.

### Verse 3

When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore, I'll be satisfied; There I'll join the angels singing praises evermore. I'll be satisfied.

### Chorus

I'll be satisfied, I'll be satisfied; When my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord, I'll be satisfied.
