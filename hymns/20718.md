## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When we come together Sunday morning, noon, or night, we worship God, we praise His name, we want to do what's right. God asked us all to do 5 things and these we strive to do. They're easy, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and you can do them too.

### Verse 2

God wants us all to talk to Him and tell Him what we need, so we'll bow down our heads in prayer and talk so humbly. God wants us all to know His will and what the Bible says, so we will listen carefully to what the preacher says.

### Verse 3

God wants us all to praise His name and tell about His love, so we'll sing songs out joyously about our God above. God wants us all to share our things and care for those in need, so we'll give Him our money and do it cheerfully.

### Verse 4

God wants us all to not forget how His Son Jesus, died, so we'll partake most rev'rently the bread and fruit of the vine. The things He asks us all to do are not that hard you see, so let's all get togeher now and do them happily.
