### Verse 1

A river of crimson flowed from His side. A river of crimson made me alive. He was born for my sorrows and died on that tree. A river of crimson flowed down to me.

### Verse 2

A river of crimson flowed for my sins. A river of crimson cleansed me within. He was born for my sorrows and died on that tree. A river of crimson washed over me.

### Verse 3

A river of crimson opened my eyes. A river of crimson made my heart cry. He was born for my sorrows and died on that tree. A river of crimson beckoned to me.

### Verse 4

A river of crimson, precious and clear. A river of crimson brings us so near. Jesus bore all our sorrows and died on that tree. A river of crimson flowed down to me.
