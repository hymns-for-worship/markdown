# 184 - Without Him

## Notation

F - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Without him I could do nothing, without him I'd surely fail; without him I would be hopeless like a ship without a sail.

### Verse 2

Without him I would be dying, without Him I'd be enslaved; without him life would be hopeless, but with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved.

### Chorus

Jesus, o Jesus! Do you know him today? Do not turn him away. O Jesus, O Jesus, without how lost I would be.
