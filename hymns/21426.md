## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord, help us all to walk each day, to look unto Thee and not to stray; Thy blood which was shed was shed for us if we would in Thee our souls entrust!

### Verse 2

May each of us know that someone near is looking at us, our words, our deeds; So Jesus, our Lord, help us to serve that others may see in us Thy love!

### Verse 3

Belonging to Thee sets us apart as workers to tell both near and far; Believe on His name, repent, confess, be buried with Him and you'll be blessed!

### Chorus

Jesus, Savior and King! To Thee praises we sing! Guide us each in Thy way, we give Thee all the praise!
