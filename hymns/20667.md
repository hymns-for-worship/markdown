### Verse 1

Have you seen a rainbow in the sky? Do you ever wonder, "Why, O why?" After rain the sun shines bright. There's a rainbow, What a sight. Why'd God put a rainbow in the sky?

### Verse 2

God told Noah take a look up high. See the rainbow I put in the sky. It's a promise to all men. I won't flood the earth again. So I put a rainbow in the sky.
