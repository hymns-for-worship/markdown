## Lyrics

### Verse 1

No one of us has got it all together, But all of us together got it all; And so we must walk hand in hand with one another, Ev'ry sister, ev'ry brother in the Lord. Sometimes I wonder why we've got to fuss and fight, When Jesus prayed, "Father make us one." O, don't you think it's time we let His great love shine, And start walking in the glory of God's love.
