## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear; what a privilege to carry ev'rything to God in prayer. O what peace we often forfeit, o what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.

### Verse 2

Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful, who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness, take it to the Lord in prayer.

### Verse 3

Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge take it to the Lord in prayer. Do thy friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer; in His arms He'll take and shield thee, thou wilt find a solace there.
