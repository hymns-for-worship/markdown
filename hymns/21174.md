## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today For a soul, returning from the wild! See! the Father meets him out upon the way, Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.

### Verse 2

Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today, For the wand'rer now is reconciled. Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way, And is born anew, a ransomed child.

### Verse 3

Ring the bells of heaven! spread the feast today! Angels, swell the glad, triumphant strain! Tell the joyful tidings; bear it far away, For a precious soul is born again.

### Chorus

Glory! glory! how the angels sing! Glory! glory! how the voices ring! 'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea, Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
