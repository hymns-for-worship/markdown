## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Living for Jesus a life that is true, Striving to please Him in all that I do; Yielding allegiance, gladhearted and free, This is the pathway of blessing for me. 

### Verse 2

 Living for Jesus who died in my place, Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace; Such love constrains me to answer His call, Follow His leading and give Him my all. 

### Verse 3

 Living for Jesus wherever I am, Doing each duty in His holy name; Willing to suffer affliction and loss, Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

### Chorus

O Jesus, Lord and Savior, I give myself to Thee, For Thou in Thy atonement, Didst give Thyself for me; I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne; My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone. 

### Verse 4

Living for Jesus thru earth's little while, My dearest treasure, the light of His smile; Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem, Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
