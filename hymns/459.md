## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How precious is the Book divine, By inspiration giv'n! Bright as a lamp its precepts shine To guide my soul to heav'n.

### Verse 2

 It sweetly cheers my drooping heart, In this dark vale of tears; Light to my life it still imparts, And quells my rising fears.

### Verse 3

 This lamp, thru all the tedious night Of life, shall guide my way, Till I behold the clearer light Of an eternal day. 

### Chorus

Holy Book divine! Precious treasure mine! Lamp to my feet and a light to my way To guide me safely home.
