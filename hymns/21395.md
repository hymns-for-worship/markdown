## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed be the fountain of blood, To a world of sinners revealed; Blessed be the dear Son of God: Only by His stripes we are healed. Tho' I've wandered far from His fold, Bringing to my heart pain and woe, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb.

### Verse 2

Thorny was the crown that He wore, And the cross His body o'ercame; Grievous were the sorrows He bore, But He suffered thus not in vain. May I to that fountain be led, Made to cleanse my sins here below; Wash me in the blood that He shed, And I shall be whiter than snow.

### Verse 3

Father I have wandered from Thee, Often has my heart gone astray; Crimson do my sins seem to me, I cannot wash them away: Jesus to that fountain of Thine, Leaning on Thy promise I go; Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,

### Chorus

Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow; Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.
