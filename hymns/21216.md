## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Arise, my soul, arise, Shake off thy guilty fears; The bleeding Sacrifice In thy behalf appears. Before the throne my Surety stands, My name is written on His hands, My name is written on His hands.

### Verse 2

He ever lives above, For me to intercede; His all-redeeming love, His precious blood to plead. His blood atoned for all our race, And sprinkles now the throne of grace, And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

### Verse 3

To God I'm reconciled, His pard'ning voice I hear; He owns me for His child, I can no longer fear. With confidence I now draw nigh, And "Father, Abba Father," cry, And "Father, Abba Father," cry.

### Coda

His Spirit answers to the blood, And tells me I am born of God, And tells me I am born of God.
