## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I saw the cross of Jesus, When burdened with my sin; I sought the cross of Jesus, To give me peace within; I bro’t my soul to Jesus, He cleansed it in His blood; And in the cross of Jesus I found my peace with God.

### Verse 2

I love the cross of Jesus, It tells me what I am A vile and guilty creature, Saved only thru the Lamb; No righteousness nor merit, No beauty can I plead; Yet in the cross I glory, My title there I read.

### Verse 3

I trust the cross of Jesus, In ev’ry trying hour, My sure and certain refuge, My never-failing tow’r; In ev’ry fear and conflict, I more than conqu’ror am; Living, I'm safe, or dying, Thru Christ, the risen Lamb.

### Verse 4

Safe in the cross of Jesus! There let my weary heart Still rest in peace unshaken, Till with Him, ne'er to part; And then in strains of glory I'll sing His wondrous pow’r, Where sin can never enter, And death is known no more.
