## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Here we behold the dawn of bliss, Here we behold the Savior's grace; Here we behold His precious blood, Which sweetly pleads for us with God. 



### Verse 2

While here we sit we would implore That love may spread from shore to shore; Till all the saints like us combine To praise the Lord in songs divine.


### Verse 3

We by the bread, and cup, we view What boundless curses were our due; But thru the off'ring of our Lord More than was lost is now restored.
