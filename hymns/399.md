## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Face to face with Christ my Savior, Face to face what will it be, When with rapture I behold Him, Jesus Christ, who died for me?

### Verse 2

 Only faintly now I see Him, With the darkling veil between, But a blessed day is coming, When His glory shall be seen.

### Verse 3

 Face to face! O blissful moment! Face to face to see and know; Face to face with my Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who loves me so. 

### Chorus

Face to face shall I behold Him, Far beyond the starry sky, Face to face in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by.
