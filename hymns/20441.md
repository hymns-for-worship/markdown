## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am thinking today of that beautiful land I shall reach when the sun goeth down; When thru wonderful grace by my Savior I stand, Will there be any stars in my crown?

### Verse 2

In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray, Let me watch as a winner of souls, That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day, When His praise like the sea billow rolls.

### Verse 3

O what joy it will be when His face I behold, Living gems at His feet to lay down! It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold, Should there be any stars in my crown.

### Chorus

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown When at evening the sun goeth down? When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest, Will there be any stars in my crown?
