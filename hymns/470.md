## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Have you a heart that's weary, Tending a load of care; Are you a soul that's seeking Rest from the burden you bear?

### Verse 2

 Where is your heart, O pilgrim, What does your light reveal; Who hears your call for comfort When naught but sorrow you feel?

### Verse 3

 Who knows your disappointment, Who hears each time you cry; Who understands your heartaches, Who dries the tears from your eyes?

### Chorus

Do you know my Jesus, Do you know (Do you know) my friend, Have you heard (Have you heard) He loves you, And that He will abide till the end?
