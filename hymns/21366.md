### Verse 1

God is Love; His mercy brightens All the path in which we rove; Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens: God is Wisdom, God is Love.

Chance and change are busy ever; Man decays, and ages move; But His mercy waneth never: God is Wisdom, God is Love.

### Verse 3

E'en the hour that darkest seemeth Will His changeless goodness prove; From the mist His brightness streameth: God is Wisdom, God is Love.

He with earthly cares entwineth Hope and comfort from above; Everywhere His glory shineth: God is Wisdom, God is Love.
