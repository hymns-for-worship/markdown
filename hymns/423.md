### Verse 1

Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to take Him at His word; Just to rest upon His promise, Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

### Verse 2

O how sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to trust His cleansing blood, Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.

### Verse 3

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus, Just from sin and self to cease; Just from Jesus simply taking  Life and rest, and joy and peace. 

### Verse 4

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me to the end.

### Chorus

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more.
