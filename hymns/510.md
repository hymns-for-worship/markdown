## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Sweet is the promise, "I will not forget thee," Nothing can molest or turn my soul away; E'en  tho' the night be dark within the valley, Just beyond is shining an eternal day.

### Verse 2

 Trusting the promise, "I will not forget thee," Onward will I go with songs of joy and love; Tho' earth despise me, tho' my friends forsake me, I shall be remembered in my home above. 

### Verse 3

 When at the golden portals I am standing, All my tribulations, all my sorrows past, How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation, "Enter, faithful servant, welcome home at last."

### Chorus

I will not forget thee or leave thee; In my hands I'll hold thee, In my arms I'll fold thee, I will not forget thee or leave thee; I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
