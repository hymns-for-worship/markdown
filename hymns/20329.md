## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When in His glory the Savior I see, And in His likeness forever shall be; There from the trials of earth to be free, That will be glory, be glory for me.

### Verse 2

When I shall see Him descending the skies, See the dead millions from slumber arise, Hear their glad shouts as the Savior they see, That will be glory, be glory for me.

### Verse 3

When I shall stand on the right of His throne, When I shall know as I also am known, Meet with my loved ones I've longed so to see, That will be glory, be glory for me.

### Chorus

That will be glory for me, That will be glory for me, There at His side in His love to abide, That will be glory, be glory for me.
