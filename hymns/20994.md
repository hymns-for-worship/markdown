### Verse 1

Blest be the everlasting God, The Father of our Lord; Be His abounding mercy praised, His majesty adored, His majesty adored.

### Verse 2

When from the dead He raised His Son And called Him to the sky, He gave our souls a living hope That they should never die, That they should never die.

### Verse 3

To an inheritance divine He taught our hearts to rise: 'Tis uncorrupted, undefiled, Unfad-ing in the skies, Unfading in the skies.

### Verse 4

Saints by the pow'r of God are kept Till the salvation come; We walk by faith as strangers here; But Christ shall call us home, But Christ shall call us home.
