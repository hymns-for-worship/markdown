## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beauty for ashes God hath decreed! Help He provideth for ev'ry need; What is unlovely He will restore; Grace all sufficient: what need we more?

### Verse 2

God gives for sadness "garments of praise;" Stars for our twilight, strength for our days; Hope for tomorrow, care for today, Light for our footsteps all of life's way.

### Verse 3

Beauty for ashes, gladness for tears, Sunshine for darkness, faith for our fears; Peace for our turmoil, concord for strife, Heaven at last and eternal  life!
