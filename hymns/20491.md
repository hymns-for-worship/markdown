## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Something beautiful, something good. All my confusion He understood; All I had to offer Him was brokenness and strife. But he made something beautiful of my life. If there ever were dreams that were lofty and noble, they were my dreams at the start; And the hopes for life's best were the hopes that I harbored down deep in my heart; But my dreams turned to ashes, my castles all crumbled, my fortune turned to loss; So I wrapped it all in the rages of my life, and laid it at the cross!
