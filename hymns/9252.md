## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have you heard the Master calling, "Come and serve Me in My Kingdom"? Have you heard the mighty summons clearly ring? From above a Voice petitions,"Go and serve Me in My vineyard." Shall I heed it? Yes, I'll go and serve my King.

### Verse 2

Will you join the host of workers, As they serve the Blessed Master? Will you answer, "Here am I, O Lord, send me"? Will you go unto the harvest of the souls my Lord is needing? Gleams the harvest Just as far as you can see!

### Verse 3

Souls are calling here and yonder, As they did in Macedonia; Souls that thirst and hunger daily for the Word. Who shall feel their pangs of hunger, Who shall care of even wonder? Shall they perish? No, we'll tell them of our Lord.

### Chorus

Have you heard? Yes, I've heard it loud and clearly, And I knew it was for me, my Master's word. Will you go? Yes, I'm going Yes, I'm going; Yes, I'll go and gladly serve, I'll serve my Lord.
