## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a home beyond the body for the soul, tis a mansion for the blest, where from God eternal blessings ever flow and the saved forever rest.

### Verse 2

Tis a land someday my spirit shall behold in a land beyond compare; how I long to see that city made of gold and to meet my savior there.

### Verse 3

I shall rise with Jesus evermore to stay in that land beyond the sky, when the angels gently carry me away to the Father's home on high.

### Chorus

In a house where glad hosannas ever ring I shall make my home above in immortal glory evermore to sing of my savior's matchless love.
