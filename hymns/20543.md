### Verse 1

When time shall end for me, and I shall live no more, It is my fervent, earnest plea, a child of Thine to be.

### Verse 2

E'en tho' I turn to dust, and nothing more remains, My soul I pray will be with Thee, with Thee, O Lord, with thee.

Tho' men cannot reall I ever lived at all, I shall not be ashamed, O Lord, if I am known by You.

To hear You call my name, to be among the saved, To sing redemption's song in heav'n, to see Your face at last.
