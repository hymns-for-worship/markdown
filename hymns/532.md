## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Tho' the way we journey may be often drear,  On that blessed morning clouds will disappear; 

### Verse 2

 After pain and anguish, after toil and care, We shall see the King some day;  Thru the endless ages joy and blessing share, We shall see the King some day. 

### Verse 3

 After foes are conquered, after battles won, some day; After strife is over, after set of sun, 

### Chorus

We shall see the King some day, (some day,) We shall shout and sing some day: Gathered 'round the throne when He shall call His own, We shall see the King some day.
