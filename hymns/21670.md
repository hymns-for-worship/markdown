## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, continue with me thru this passing day; Lead me for your glory; Set me in your way. Tho' my feet may stumble, Do not hide your face. Teach me to be humble, Trusting in your grace.



### Verse 2

Lord, continue with me In my time of grief; Tho' affliction find me, You will give relief. When you hear my sorrow, All my worries cease. You control tomorrow; Let my faith increase. 



### Verse 3

Lord, continue with me Till my final hour; As my steps grow weary, Keep me in your pow’r. You will not forsake me, For your word is true; When, at last, you take me, I will be with you.
