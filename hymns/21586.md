## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O courage, my soul, and let us journey on, for tho' the night is dark, it won't be very long. O thanks be to God, the morning light appears, And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah!





### Verse 2

O billows rolling high, and thunder shakes the ground, The lightnings flash, and tempest all around, But Jesus walks the sea and calms the angry waves, And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah!

### Verse 3

The stars have disappeared, and distant lights are dim, My soul is filled with fears, the seas are breaking in. I hear the Master cry, "Be not afraid, 'tis I," And the storm is passing over, Hallelujah!

### Verse 4

Now soon we shall reach the distant shining shore, Then free from all the storms, we'll rest forevermore. And safe within the veil, we'll furl the riven sail, And the storm will all be over, Hallelujah!

### Chorus

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The storm is passing over, Hallelujah!
