## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me, see on the portals he's waiting and watching, watching for you and for me.

### Verse 2

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and heed not his mercies, mercies for you and for me?

### Verse 3

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing, passing from you and from me; shadows are gathering, lifes end is coming, coming from you and from me.

### Verse 4

O! for the wonderful love he has promised, promised for you and for me, tho we have sinned he has mercy and pardon, pardon for you and for me.

### Chorus

Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home; earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling, calling o, sinner, come home.
