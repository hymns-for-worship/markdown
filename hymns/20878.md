## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tears so gentle at the grave of Lazarus, To help sad friends their broken hearts to mend. Yes, Jesus cares when our loved ones pass away, And comforts thru His word each lonely day.

### Verse 2

Tears of sorrow He wept for Jerusalem. His grace and love rejected by lost men. Yes, Jesus grieves for the sinful ones astray. O, careless soul, prepare  for judgment day.

### Verse 3

Tears of anguish poured out in Gethsemane; He drank the cup, the suff'ring cup for all. Yes, Jesus yearns that the slaves of sin be free By precious blood He shed on Calvary.

### Chorus

Tears of anguish poured out in Gethsemane; He drank the cup, the suff'ring cup for all. Yes, Jesus yearns that the slaves of sin be free By precious blood He shed on Calvary.
