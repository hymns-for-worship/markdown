### Verse 1

O, ye Christian soldiers, as you march along, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day; Keep His banner hoisted all the whole day long, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day.

### Verse 2

Keep your lamps trimmed, burning so that all may see, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day; Let the world see Jesus and from sin be free. Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day.

### Verse 3

Thousands grope in darkness that can never see, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day; Until we point them up to Mount Calvary, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day.

### Chorus

Be a light, Be a light, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day, Be a light, Be a light, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day. Bright, shining light, Bright, shining light ev'ry day, Bright, shining light, be a shining light,

### Verse 4

Keep the light bright, shining all the world around, Be a light for Je-sus ev'ry day; 'Till, released from darkness, all the Lord  have found, Be a light for Jesus ev'ry day.
