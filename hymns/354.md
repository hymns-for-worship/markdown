### Verse 1

 Unspotted is the fear of God, And ever doth endure; The judgments of the Lord are truth, And righteousness most pure.

### Verse 2

 They more than gold, yes, much fine gold, To be desired are, Than honey from the honeycomb That droppeth sweeter far. 

### Verse 3

 Moreover they, Thy servant warn, How he his life should frame; A great reward provided is For them that keep the same. 

### Chorus

O how love I Thy law, O how love I thy law, It is my meditation all the day; O how love I Thy law, O how love I Thy law; It is my meditation all the day. (all the day.)
