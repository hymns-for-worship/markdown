## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home, And our eternal home. 


### Verse 2

Under the shadow of Thy throne Thy saints have dwelt secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure, And our defense is sure.


### Verse 3

Before the hills in order stood Or earth received her frame, From everlasting Thou art God, To endless years the same, To endless years the same.

### Verse 4

A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone, Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun, Before the rising sun.

### Verse 5

Time, like an everrolling stream, Bears all its sons away; They fly, forgotten, as a dream Dies at the op'ning day, Dies at the op'ning day.

### Verse 6

O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Be Thou our guide while life shall last, And our eternal home, And our eternal home.
