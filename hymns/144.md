## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine; now hear me while I pray, take all my sins away, o let me from this day be wholy Thine!

### Verse 2

May Thy rich grace impart strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire; as Thou hast died for me, o may my love to Thee pure, warm, and changeless be a living fire!

### Verse 3

While life's dark maze I tread, and grief around me spread, be Thou my guide; bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow's tears away, nor let me ever stay from Thee aside.
