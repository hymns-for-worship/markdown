# 146 - Have Thine Own Way, Lord

## Notation

Eb - 9/4 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! Thou art the potter, I am the clay. Mold me and make me after thy will, while I am waiting, yielding and still.

### Verse 2

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! Search me and try me, master today! Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now, as in thy presence, humbly I bow.

### Verse 3

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! Hold o'er my being absolute sway! Fill with thy spirit till all shall see Christ, only, always living in me!
