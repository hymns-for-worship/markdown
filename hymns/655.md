# 655 - The Walls Came Tumbling Down

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The Lord told Joshua to go to Jericho, And to march sev'n times a round; He followed faithfully the blessed Lord's command, And the walls came tumbling down.

### Verse 2

 If you are trusting in the power of the blood, And you hope to wear a crown; Go forward quickly, and obey the holy word, Walls of doubt will tumble down.

### Verse 3

 The Lord is calling, sinner, come to Him today, Turn from this vain world's renown; If you will follow Him in faith, like Joshua, Walls of sin will tumble down. 

### Chorus

Yes, the walls came tumbleing down; Joshua, marched seven times 'round, Then the walls came tumbleing down, And the walls came tumbling down.
