## Notation

F - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What a song of delight in that city so bright, we'll be wafted neath heaven's fair dome, how the ransomed will raise happy songs in his praise when all of God's singers get home.

### Verse 2

As we sing here on earth, songs of sadness or mirth, tis a fortaste of rapture to come; but our joy can't compare with the glory up there, when all of God's singers get home.

### Verse 3

Having overcome sin, hallelujah, amen, will be heard in that land o'er the foam, every heart will be light and each face will be bright, when all of God's singers get home.

### Chorus

When all of God's singers get home, where never a sorrow will come; there'll be no place like home, when all of God's singers get home.
