## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Mighty is the Lord, our God, give praise to His great name, great name; saints of earth and hosts of heav'n proclaim abroad His fame; come rejoicing, shout "Hosanna" that all men may see; mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

### Verse 2

Holy is the Lord of Hosts, whose reign shall never cease, ne'er cease; He can save the fallen race and give the fallen peace; all the earth should sing His praises, for He makes us free; mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

### Verse 3

Mighty is our God, Jehovah, wondrous is His grace, His grace; He is building now in heav'n, that we might have a place; how he makes us want to serve Him, His own people be; mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

### Chorus

Mighty is the Lord who dwelleth in the heavens, mighty is the Lord who ruleth o'er the sea; mighty is the Lord who never sleeps nor slumbers, mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.
