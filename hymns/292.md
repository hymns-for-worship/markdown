## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord's my shepherd I'll not want; he makes me down to lie in pastures green, he leadeth me the quiet waters by.

### Verse 2

My soul he doth restore again, and me to walk doth make within the paths of righteousness, e'en for his own names sake.

### Verse 3

Yea, tho I walk in deaths dark vale, yet will I fear no ill; for thou art with me and thy rod and staff me comfort still.

### Verse 4

My table thou hast furnished in presence of my foes; my head thou doest with oil annoint, and my cup overflows.

### Verse 5

Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me, and in God's house forever more my dwelling place shall be.
