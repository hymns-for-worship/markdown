## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blest be the dear uniting love That will not let us part: Our bodies may far off remove, We still are one in heart.

### Verse 2

Joined in one Spirit to our Head, Where He appoints we go, And still in Jesus' footsteps tread, And show His praise below.

### Verse 3

O may we ever walk in Him, And nothing know beside, Nothing desire, nothing esteem, But Jesus crucified.

### Verse 4

Closer and closer let us cleave To His beloved embrace, Expect His fullness to receive, And grace to answer grace.

### Verse 5

Partakers of the Savior's grace, The same in mind and heart, nor joy, nor grief, nor time, nor place, Nor life, nor death can part.
