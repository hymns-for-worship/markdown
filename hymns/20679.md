# 20679 - SWEET BEULAH LAND

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm kind of homesick for a country to which I've never been before; No sad goodbyes will there be spoken, for time won't matter anymore.

### Verse 2

I'm looking now across the river, where my faith will end in sight; There's just a few more days to labor, then I will take my heav'nly flight.

### Verse 3

I see the lights, I hear the singing; A brand new song of joy divine. My soul rejoices just in knowing that soon these pleasures will be mine.

### Chorus

Beulah land, I'm longing for you, and someday on Thee I'll stand; Where my home shall be eternal; Beulah land, sweet Beulah land.
