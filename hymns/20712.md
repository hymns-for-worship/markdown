## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hold on, hold on to the word you have heard; For the word will see you thru. You may bear a heavy load trav'ling to your new abode; Hold on, dear friend, hold on!

### Verse 2

Hold on, hold on to the love given you; For you know He loves you so. To this cross He went to die To give you a home on high. Hold on, dear friend, hold on!

### Verse 3

Hold on, hold on, you must think Calvary Where He suffered just for you. There He drank the bitter cup, wore a crown and gave it up; Hold on, dear friend, hold on!

### Chorus

Your burden may be hard to bear; Keep your eye on the crown you'll wear. You must hold the Savior's hand. He will lead to heaven's land. Hold on, dear friend, hold on!
