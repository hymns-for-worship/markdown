### Verse 1

Purer in heart, o God, help me to be; may I devote my life wholy to thee. Watch thou my wayward feet, guide me with counsel sweet; purer in heart, help me to be.

### Verse 2

Purer in heart, o God, help me to be; teach me to do Thy will most lovingly. Be thou my friend and guide, let me with thee abide; purer in heart, help me to be.

Purer in heart, o God, help me to be; that I thy holy face one day may see. Keep me from secret sin, reign thou my soul within; purer in heart, help me to be.
