## Notation

Bb - 2/2 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You were there when the world had turned against me. When the darkness had possessed my soul, Your tender mercy made me whole. When I followed You, my life was filled with meaning From the morning to the evening. I've seen the face of God. 

### Verse 2

come once again bringing all I have to offer, Just to find a dark and empty tomb, Your holy frame somehow ehumed. Then I hear someone say, "Why are tears so freely falling? Can't you hear the voice that's calling? A voice that knows your name."

### Coda

Rabboni My Teacher my God, You're alive and my burdens melt away.
