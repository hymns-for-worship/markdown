## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Almighty Father, hear my plea; In ev'ry action, strengthen me; In all the work that You may send, Please help me be Your constant friend.

### Verse 2

When I approach those gone astray, Then use me to defend your Way And make your truth so evident That all who hear it will repent.

### Verse 3

If I should lose all I have known And with my tears be left alone, Then fill my loneliness with grace And make Your love my dwelling place.

### Verse 4

And when my labor here is done, Complete the work that I've begun, And help the ones I've brought to You To labor in Your service too.
