## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The God of Abrah'm praise, Who reigns enthroned above; Ancient of everlasting days, And God of Love; Jehovah, great I AM, By earth and heav'n confessed; I bow and bless the sacred name, For ever blest.



### Verse 2

The God of Abrah'm praise, At whose supreme command From earth I rise and seek the joys At His right hand; I all on earth forsake, Its wisdom, fame and pow'r; And Him my only portion make, My shield and tow'r.



### Verse 3

He by Himself hath sworn: I on His oath depend; I shall, on angelwings upborne, To heav'n ascend; I shall behold His face, I shall His pow'r adore, And sing the wonders of His grace For evermore.
