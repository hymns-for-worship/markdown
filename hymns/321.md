## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Out of my bondage, sorrow and night, Jesus I come, Jesus I come; into thy freedom, gladness and light, Jesus I come to thee; out of my sickness into thy health, out of my want and into thy wealth,  out of my sin and into thyself, Jesus I come to thee.

### Verse 2

Out of my shameful failure and loss, Jesus I come, Jesus I come, into thy glorious gain of thy cross, Jesus I come to thee, out of earth's sorrow into thy balm, out of life's storms and into thy calm, out of distress to jubilent psalm, Jesus I come to thee.

### Verse 3

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb, Jesus I come, Jesus I come, into the joy and light of thy home, Jesus I come to thee; out of the depths of ruin untold, into the peace of thy sheltering fold, ever thy glorious face to behold, Jesus I come to thee. 

### Coda

Amen.
