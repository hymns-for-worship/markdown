## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The less I am, the more Thou art; O Jesus, humble me! Take Thou possession of my heart, Thy dwelling let it be!

### Verse 2

Thou, Savior, wilt be all or nought, Be all in all to me, Alas! how much in me is wrought, That cometh not from Thee.

### Verse 3

Down from each lofty height of pride, May I be cast by Thee; That dead to self, and crucified I to the world may be.

### Verse 4

Then shall I triumph, Lord, for Thou My strength and shield wilt be; And thru Thy might I shall, e'en now, From death and sin be free.

### Verse 5

The less I am, the more Thou art; O Jesus, humble me! Take Thou possession of my heart, Thy dwelling let it be!
