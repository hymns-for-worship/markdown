# 9250 - Be Thou Faithful Unto Death

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A crown of life is waiting for the faithful and true; A reminder that the lord only says just what He'll do. The jewels of that kingdom outshine the brightest day. No more sorrow, pain, or death. The former things are passed away.

### Verse 2

To him that overcometh, a white robe there awaits; Cleansed in His precious blood, an adornment for the saints. We'll gather 'round the great throne and to him praises sing, For He's kept His promises, he's made us prophets, priest and kings.

### Chorus

In that City up above the steets with gold are laid. We'll live forever more in the mansions that He's made, Our promised land of heaven is on the other side. Be thou faithful unto death, for He'll receive His precious bride.
