## Notation

A - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Forever O may the Lord's glory stand! The Lord shall enjoy each work of His hand. He looks on the earth and it trembles in fear; When He touches mountains, the smoke  will appear. 

### Verse 2

 I'll sing to the Lord as long as I live, Sing praise to my God while life   He will give. My tho'ts about Him will sweet pleasure afford, For I am rejoicing each day in the Lord. 

### Verse 3

 Consumed from the earth let sinners then be; The wicked in life no more  let us see. And now, O my soul, blessing give to the Lord; Let glad hallelujahs ring; O praise the Lord!
