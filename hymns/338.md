## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The great physician now is near the sympathyzing Jesus, he speaks the drooping heart to cheet, o hear the voice of Jesus. 

### Verse 2

All glory to the dying lamb! I now believe in Jesus, I love the blessed savior's name, I love the name of Jesus.

### Verse 3

His name dispels my guilt and fear, no other name but Jesus; o how my soul delights to hear, the charming name of Jesus.

### Verse 4

And when to that bright world above we rise to see our Jesus; we'll sing around the throne of love, his name, the name of Jesus.

### Chorus

Sweetest note in seraph song, sweetest name on mortal tongue, sweetest carol ever sun, Jesus, blessed Jesus.
