## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I will tell the love of Jesus, To the rich and poor alike; I will help the wand'ring sinner To find the paths of right.


### Verse 2

I will live a pure clean life, That will be a light to men; By my life I'll preach the Gospel That will save men from all sin.

### Verse 3

When I think of what Christ suffered On the cross for you and me; It does make me feel ashamed Of what little I've done for Thee.

### Verse 4

I will read Thy Word each day, So I'll better understand; I will study Thy Book carefully, And I'll follow Thy command.


### Verse 5

I will give my life to Thee, I will tell Thy love each day; I will only use the Bible To lead men to Thy way.


### Chorus

I will work for Christ each day, I will live the Gospel way; I will never, never stray, So in Heaven I may stay.
