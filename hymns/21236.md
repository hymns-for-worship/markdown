## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One blessed hour with Jesus our Lord, One blessed hour to feast on His word; One blessed hour with Jesus apart, One blessed hour to calm the troubled heart.

### Verse 2

One blessed hour with Jesus to plead, One blessed hour to tell Him our need; One blessed hour refreshing and sweet, One blessed hour to sit at Jesus' feet.

### Verse 3

One blessed hour from labor to rest; One blessed hour to lean on His breast; Loving and loved, His favor to share, One blessed hour of soul-reviving prayer. 

### Verse 4

One blessed hour with Jesus our King, One blessed hour to speak and to sing; One blessed hour with Jesus, how dear! Surely ’tis Heav’n, and Heav’n itself is here. 

### Chorus

One sweet hour of holy, calm delight, One sweet hour of tender melting love; One sweet hour, O precious Savior, One sweet hour with Thee.
