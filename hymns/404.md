## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Arise! the Master calls for thee, The harvest days are here! No longer sit with folded hands, But gather far and near. The noble ranks of volunteers Are daily growing ev'rywhere, But still there's work for millions more! Then for the field prepare.

### Verse 2

Go seek the lost and erring ones, Who never knew the Lord; Go, lead them from the ways of sin, And thou shalt have reward. Go out into the hedges, where The careless drift upon the tide, And from the highways bring them in Let no one be denied.

### Verse 3

 The message bear to distant lands Beyond the rolling sea; Go tell them of a Savior's love— The Lamb of Calvary. Arise! the Master calls for thee! Salvation full and free proclaim, Till ev'ry kindred, tribe and tongue Exalt the Savior's name!

### Chorus

Arise! Arise! Arise! Arise! Arise! The field is white Arise! Awake! Awake Arise! Arise! The Master calls for thee, Arise! Arise! A faithful reaper be, Arise!
