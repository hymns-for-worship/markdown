## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, I often have turned from You And grieved You with my sin; I've prayed for strength to see Your will And walk with You again. But now I ask for more than strength: I plead for meekness too; For only in humility Will I be close to You.

### Verse 2

Lord, if I do not leave my pride But cling instead to sin, I know that You must humble me To give me life again. But if I come to You, cast down, And truly see Your grace, I know that You will lift me up That I may see Your face.
