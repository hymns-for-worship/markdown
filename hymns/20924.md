## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If my time on earth is long And I am young And I see God's people dying, I want to help them. For if Jesus comes tomorrow I'll have just one more day.

### Verse 2

If you have no peace with Jesus, The Son of God, The angels must be crying, His heart is broken. For if Jesus comes tomorrow I'll have just one more day.  One more day and time will be no longer, One day late for me to show you, One day late for you to listen. For when He comes, there'll be no warning, We would not know,
