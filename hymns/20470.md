## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus the Lord laid his glory aside, Sinners to save and make whole, Freely He died our transgressions to hide, what is He worth to your soul?

### Verse 2

All that was His for the sinner he gave, Pointed the path to the goal; Sin would deprave, but the Savior would save, What is He worth to your soul?

### Verse 3

All who will trust Him in sunshine and *gloam, Shall when they reach the bright goal; Ceasing to roam, be forever at home, what is He worth to your soul?

### Chorus

What is He worth, to you, What is He worth, to you, What is he worth to your soul? He died on the cruel tree, for you and for me, What is he worth to your soul?
