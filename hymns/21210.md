## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Brief life is here our portion; Brief sorrow, short-lived care: The life that knows no ending, The tearless life is there.

### Verse 2

And now we fight the battle, But then shall wear the crown Of full, and everlasting, And passionless renown.

### Verse 3

The morning shall awaken, The shadows shall decay, And each true-hearted servant Shall shine as doth the day.

### Verse 4

There God, our King and portion, In fullness of His grace, Shall we behold forever, And worship face to face.
