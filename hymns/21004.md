Come from the loathsome way of sin, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Come, for the Lord will take you in, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

Come to the shelter's safe retreat, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Come, for the storms around you beat, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

Come, for your sins the Lord has bled, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Come, tho' they be like crimson red, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

### Verse 4

Come, there is safety in the blood, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Now plunge beneath the crimson flood, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

Come now, believing in the Lord, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Trusting His grace and precious word, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

Come from your burden, come apart, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; Give Him possession of your heart, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

Come for the crisis hour is near, Hide you in the blood of Jesus; The King of kings will soon appear, Hide you in the blood of Jesus.

O hide you in the blood, For the storms are raging high, O hide you in the blood, Till the dangers pass you by.
