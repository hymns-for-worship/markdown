## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God is calling the prodigal come without delay; hear, o hear him calling, calling now for thee; who you've wandered so far from his presence come today, hear his loving voice calling still.

### Verse 2

Patient, loving, and tenderly still the father pleads; hear, o hear him calling, calling now for thee; o! return while the spirit in mercy intercedes, hear his loving voice calling still.

### Verse 3

Come, there's bread in the house of the father, and to spare; hear, o hear his calling, calling now for thee; lo! The table is spread and the feast is waiting there, hear his loving voice calling still.

### Chorus

Calling now for thee, o weary prodigal come, calling now for thee, o weary prodigal come.
