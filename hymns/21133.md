## Notation

G - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the silence of my heart, full of cares that never cease, seeking answers in His Word, words of love and promised peace. For life is hard and hope grows dim, I need my God for strength within.  I am waiting, waiting still. I am waiting for my God.

### Verse 2

In the trials of His rod, In the sorrows all about. I am brought to knees of prayer, as I fight the pit of doubt. For in His time, He'll answer me, and it will soon or later be. I am waiting, waiting still. I am waiting for my God.

### Verse 3

 I lift eyes up to His throne, for with Him I'm not alone. Thru His truth, He leads me on, safely thru this vast unknown. For in His likeness I will grow, Live for His glory He has shown. I am waiting, waiting still. I am waiting for my God.
