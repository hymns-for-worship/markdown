### Verse 1

By christ redeemed, in christ restored, we keep the supper of the word, and show the death of our dear Lord, until he come.

### Verse 2

His body given in our stead is seen in this memorial bread, and as we drink we see the blood, until he come.

And thus that dark betrayal night with the last advent we unite, by one bright chain of loving rite, until he come.
