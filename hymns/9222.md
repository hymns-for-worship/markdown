## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I know this life is filled with sin and sorrow, And there are times when I feel so alone; But Jesus came to make a new tomorrow, he gave his life that I might be His own.

### Verse 2

I know my life is filled with joy and gladness; My Savior walks beside me ev'ry day. He gives me hope to take away my sadness; I walk with Him, the True and Living way.

### Verse 3

I know when years have passed and night is falling, And time for me will end and be no more, There is no doubt on Whom I will be calling; My Lord and King will meet me at the door.

### Verse 4

I know some day that I will meet my Maker; Before His great white throne there I shall stand. I know that He will be the great Awaker, Then I shall see the power of His hand.
