## Notation

G - 3/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt, Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured, There where the blood of the Lamb was shed. 

### Verse 2

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide, What can avail to wash it away? Look! there is flowing a crimson tide; Whiter than snow you may be today.

### Verse 3

 Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, Freely bestowed on all who believe; You that are long-ing to see His face, Will you this moment His grace receive? 

### Chorus

Grace, grace, God's grace, Grace that will pardon and cleanse within; Grace, grace, God's grace, Grace that is greater than all our sin.
