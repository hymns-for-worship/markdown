Come my soul, your plea prepare; God the Father answers prayer. He Himself has bid you pray: Therefore will not turn away.

You are coming to a King; Therefore large petitions bring. For His grace and pow'rs are such: None can ever ask too much.

Lord, to Thee I come for rest; Dwell forever in my breast. There Thy blood bought right maintain, And without a rival reign.
