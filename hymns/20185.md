## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear; What a privilege to carry ev-’rything to God in prayer. O what peace we often forfeit O what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry ev ’rything to God in prayer.

### Verse 2

Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful, Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our ev’ry weakness: Take it to the Lord in prayer.

### Verse 3

Are we weak and heavy laden, ’Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge, Take it to the Lord in prayer. Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer; In His arms He’ll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.
