### Verse 1

 The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide, A shelter in the time of storm; Secure whatever ill betide, A shelter in the time of storm.

### Verse 2

 A shade by day, defence by night, A shelter in the time of storm; No fears alarm, no foes affright, A shelter in the time of storm.

### Verse 3

 O Rock divine, O Refuge dear, A shelter in the time of storm; Be Thou our helper ever near, A shelter in the time of storm. 

### Chorus

O Jeus is a Rock in a weary land,  A weary land, a weary land; O Jesus is a Rock in a weary land, A shelter in the time of storm.
