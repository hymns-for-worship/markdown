## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Beyond the clouds by faith we see Our heav'nly home eternally. Thru mist of time we slowly trod To live forever there with God.

### Verse 2

Let us rejoice when we look back To see the saints that made the trek, And know that we can do that too Because Christ died for me and you.

### Verse 3

By faith the things we cannot see Some day will be reality. Around the throne to sing His praise For endless years and endless days.

### Coda

O, praise His name, Christ is our King! He reigns in heav'n O'er ev'rything. O, praise His name, Christ is our King! He is our King! Christ is our King!
