### Verse 1

1. Glory be to God the Father, Glory be to God the Son,
Glory be to God the Spirit— Great Jehovah, Three in One! Glory, glory, glory, glory, While eternal ages run, While eternal ages run!

### Verse 2

Glory be to Him who loved us, Washed us from each spot and stain; Glory be to Him who bought us, Made us kings with Him to reign! Glory, glory, glory, glory, To the Lamb that once was slain, To the Lamb that once was slain!

### Verse 3

Glory, blessing, praise eternal! Thus the choir of angels sings! Honor, riches, pow'r, dominion! Thus its praise creation brings! Glory, glory, glory, glory, Glory to the King of Kings, Glory to the King of Kings!
