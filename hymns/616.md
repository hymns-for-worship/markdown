# 616 - Into Our Hands

## Notation

G - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Swiftly we're turning life's daily pages, Swiftly the hours are changing to years; How are we using God's golden moments? Shall we reap glory? Shall we reap tears?

### Verse 2

 Millions are groping without the gospel, Quickly they'll reach eternity's night; Shall we sit idly as they rush onward? Haste, let us hold up Christ the true light.

### Verse 3

 Souls that are precious, souls that are dying, While we rejoice our sins are forgiv'n; Did He not also die for these lost ones? Then let us point the way unto heav'n. 

### Chorus

Into our hands the gospel is given, Into our hands is given the light, Haste, let us carry God's precious message, Guiding the erring back to the right.
