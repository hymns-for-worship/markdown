## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, give us a mind to work, And help us to see each need. Lord, help us to care And seek You in prayer, Then reach out in word and deed.

### Verse 2

Lord, give us a mind to work, Whatever our skill may be. We'll work side by side With all You provide, And serve with humility.

### Verse 3

Lord, give us a mind to work, Though challenged by enemies; We'll build and defend, Without and within, And pray, fighting on our knees.

### Verse 4

Lord, give us a mind to work, May we hear Your word with awe; Though we fall in sin, Restore us again, With joy help us keep Your law.

### Verse 5

Lord, give us a mind to work, Our life spent in love for You; May we stay on guard And keep working hard, Until Your great work is through.
