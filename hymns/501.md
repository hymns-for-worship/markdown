## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 God, be merciful to me; On Thy grace I rest my plea; In Thy vast abounding grace, My transgressions all erase; Wash me wholly from my sin, Cleanse from ev'ry ill within.

### Verse 2

 For my sins before me rise, Everpresent to my eyes; I have sinned 'gainst Thee alone, In Thy sight this evil done; That Thy judgment may be clear, And Thy sentence just appear.

### Verse 3

 From my sins hide Thou Thy face; My iniquities erase. O my God, renew my heart, And a spirit right impart. Cast me not away from Thee, Nor Thy Spirit take from me. 

### Verse 4

 Give salvation's joy again, And a willing mind sustain; Then Thy perfect ways I'll show, That transgressors them may know; Open Thou my lips, O Lord, Then my mouth shall praise accord.
