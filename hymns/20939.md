# 20939 - YOU CAN LEAD SOMEONE TO JESUS

## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a wonderful story to tell, Wonderful work to be done, Countless the souls who are eager to hear, Precious the souls to be won!

### Verse 2

You can tell someone the story of Christ, Someone that's feeble and old, Someone that's lost from the pathway of life, Bring to the sheltering fold.

### Verse 3

You can win someone that's toiling in vain, Building on perilous sand; You can persuade them to build on the rock, Safe thru the ages to stand.


### Verse 4

You can stir faith in some heart that's grown cold, Banish for someone the night; You can win someone from darkness and doubt, Back to the pathway of right.

### Chorus

You can lead someone to Jesus, You can win someone for Him, You can bring someone to Jesus, You can lead someone to Him.
