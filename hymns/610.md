# 610 - Because He Lives

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 God sent His Son, They called Him Jesus, He came to love, heal and forgive; He lived and died to buy my pardon, An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

### Verse 2

 How sweet to hold our newborn baby, And feel the pride and joy he gives; But greater still, the calm assurance, This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

### Verse 3

 And then one day I'll cross that river, I'll fight life's final war with pain; And then as death gives way to vict'ry, I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He reigns. 

### Chorus

Because He lives I can face tomorrow, Because He lives all fear is gone; Because I know He holds the future, And life is worth the living, just because He lives.
