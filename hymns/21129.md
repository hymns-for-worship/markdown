## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies. There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide. Where all the love I've ever found comes like a flood, comes flowing down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in awe of You; I'm in awe of You. Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to You; I owe all to You, Jesus.  

### Verse 2

There's a place where sin and shame are powerless. Where my heart has peace with God and forgiveness. Where all the love I've ever found comes like a flood, comes flowing down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in awe of You; I'm in awe of You. Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to You; I owe all to You, Jesus.  Where all the love I've ever found comes like a flood, comes flowing down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in awe of You; I'm in awe of You. Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to You; I owe all to You. Here my hope is found, here on holy ground, here I bow down, here I bow down. Here arms open wide, here You saved my life; Here I bow down, here I bow.
