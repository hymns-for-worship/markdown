## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All praise to our redeeming Lord, Who joins us by His grace, And bids us, each to each restored, Together seek His face.

### Verse 2

The gift which He on one bestows, We all delight to prove, The grace thru ev'ry vessel flows In purest streams of love.

### Verse 3

He bids us build each other up; And, gathered into one, To our high calling's glorious hope, We hand in hand go on.

### Verse 4

We all partake the joy of one; The common peace we feel: A peace to worldly minds unknown, A joy unspeakable.

### Verse 5

And if our fellowship below In Jesus be so sweet, What height of rapture shall we know When round His throne we meet!
