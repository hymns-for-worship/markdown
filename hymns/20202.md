### Verse 1

When I am weak, my Lord, You're strong! Loving me even when I'm wrong! Lord, You are my salvation and my song! Every day I'll make the choice! Listening, following Your voice! Being with You I can't help but rejoice 

### Verse 2

I'd like to say, Lord, from the start, Thank You for breaking thru my heart! Thank You for tearing ev'ry chain apart. When I was lost You made a way. You turned the darkest night to day! You are my joy and, Lord, I'd like to say that
