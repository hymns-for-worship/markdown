## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Over the river, shining forever, there is a city I know, wonderful story! Mansions of glory, waiting for pilgrims below.

### Verse 2

Home of the sages, saints of the ages, martyrs and angels of light; free of all sadness, city of gladness, always so peaceful and bright!

### Verse 3

Hasten tomorrow, end of all sorrow, when this glad home I shall see; when with my savior, happy forever, resting above I shall be.

### Chorus

Wonderful city, beautiful city, built without hands by our king; marvelous city, glorious city, where we forever shall sing.
