## Notation

Ab - 6/8 on 6a - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm; In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls O'er my soul like an infinite calm.

### Verse 2

What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace, Buried deep in the heart of my soul; So secure that no power can mine it away, While the years of eternity roll!

### Verse 3

And I think when I rise to that City of peace, Where the Author of peace I shall see, that one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing In that heavenly kingdom will be.

### Chorus

Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In the fathomless billows of love.
