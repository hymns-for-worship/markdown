# 189 - When I Survey The Wondrous Cross

## Notation

F - 2/2 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I survey the wondrous cross on which the prince of glory died, my richest gain I count but loss and pour contempt on all my pride.

### Verse 2

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, save in the death of Christ, my Lord; all the vain things that charm me most I sacrifice them to His blood.

### Verse 3

See from His head, His hands, His feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down; did e'er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?

### Verse 4

Were the whole realm of nature mine that were a present far too small; love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
