## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If for the prize we have striven, after our labors are o'er, rest to our soul will be given on the eternal shore.

### Verse 2

Yes, a sweet rest is remaining, for the true children of God, where there will be no complaining, never a chastning rod.

### Verse 3

Soon, the bright homeland adorning, we shall behold the glad dawn; lean on the Lord till the morning, trust til the night is done.

### Chorus

Home of the soul, beautiful home, there we shall rest, never to roam, free from all care, happy and bright, Jesus is there, He is the light! Oft, in the storm, lonely are we, sighing for home, longing for thee, beautiful home of the ransomed beside the crystal sea.
