## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The earth and the riches with which it is stored, The world and its dwellers, belong to the LORD; For He on the seas its foundation has laid, And firm on the waters, and firm on the waters, And firm on the waters its pillars has stayed.

### Verse 2

O who shall the mount of Jehovah as-cend? Or who in the place of His holiness stand? The man of pure heart and of hands without stain, Who has not sworn falsely, who has not sworn falsely, Who has not sworn falsely nor loved what is vain.

### Verse 3

O gates, lift your heads! Ageless doors, lift them high! The great King of glory to enter draws nigh! This great King of glory, O who can He be? This great King of glory, This great King of glory, This great King of glory, Jehovah is He!
