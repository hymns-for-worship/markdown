### Verse 1

 Rise up, O child of God! Have done with lesser things; Give heart and soul and mind and strength To serve the King of kings.

 Rise up, O child of God! His Kingdom tarries long; Bring in the day of brotherhood And end the night of wrong.

 Rise up, O child of God! The Church for you doth wait, Her strength unequal to her task; Rise   up, and make her great!
