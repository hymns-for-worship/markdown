## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O Thou blessed Rock of Ages, Trusting now, dear Lord, in Thee; Keep me till my journey's ended, Till Thy blessed face I see. 

### Verse 2

 Keep me when the stormclouds gather, Till the sun comes shining thru; Keep me till my work is over, Till I bid this world adieu.

### Verse 3

 When my journey is completed, And there's no more work to do; Savior guide my weary spirit, Happy land beyond the blue. 

### Chorus

Hide me, O blest Rock of Ages, Till Thy blessed face I see; When the storm around me rages, Rock of Ages hide Thou me.
