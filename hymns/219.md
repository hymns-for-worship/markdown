## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How sweet, how heavenly is the sight when those that love the Lord in one another's peace delight and so fulfill the word.

### Verse 2

When each can feal his brother's sigh and with Him bear apart; when sorrow flows from eye to eye and joy from heart to heart.

### Verse 3

When, free from envy scorn and pride, our wishes all above, each can his brother's failings hide and show a brother's love.

### Verse 4

When love in one delightful stream through every bosom flows; when union sweet in dear esteem in every action glows.

### Verse 5

Love is the golden chain that binds the happy souls above; and he's an heir of heaven who finds his bosom glow with love.
