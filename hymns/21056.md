## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the waiting time is over, When the Master bids us come, In the glad and bright forever, We shall rest in peace at home.

### Verse 2

When the waiting time is over, Battles fought and vict'ries won, We shall hear the Savior's welcome, "Good and faithful one, well done."

### Verse 3

When the waiting time is over, When the toils of life are past, We shall sing with holy rapture, "Praise the Lord, we're home at last."

### Chorus

When the waiting time is over, When from sin and sorrow free, We shall meet beyond the river, There to dwell eternally.
