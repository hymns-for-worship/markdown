## Lyrics

### Verse 1

From the earth, form the sky, breaks forth the joyful cry, "Our Lord is King most high!" crucified, He revived, that's why He's King most high.

### Verse 2

Humble birth held no worth till angel voice sang forth, "A King is born this day!" Then the earth was aware its hope had come to stay.

### Verse 3

Words He gave me to say, by works He led the way this Lord and King to be. Then alone, blood atoned, His life He gave for me.

### Verse 4

Darkest pow'r He o'ercame, life for me He regained; a prophet ne'er to die; Priest fore'er on His throne: Lord, God my King most high.

### Chorus

My Lord is great and good, and He will hear my cry; He'll ever live and ever reign, my Lord and King most high.
