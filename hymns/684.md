## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In the kingdom of the Lord, Dwell the good, dwell the blest, In the kingdom of the Lord, There is peace, there is rest. To that blessed land glad my soul shall fly, When this pilgrimage, pilgrimage is o'er, Dwell beyond the sky, dwell beyond the sky, With my Savior blest, blest forever more.

### Verse 2

 In the kingdom of the Lord, Finds my tho'ts its employ, In the kingdom of the Lord, Is my hope, is my joy. Of that blessed land land so fair and bright, Traveling along, traveling along, Almost catch the sight, almost catch the sight, Almost hear the song, almost hear the song.

### Verse 3

 In the kingdom of the Lord, Thru the bow'rs I shall roam, In the kingdom of the Lord, in my bright heav'nly home. To that blessed land Thine are my desires, Savior's blest abode, Savior's blest abode, Thee, my heart aspires, Thee, my heart aspires, Homeland of my God, homeland of my God. 

### Chorus

When the sun is sinking low, So oft I sing, so sweetly sing, Of that land to which I go, Where my Father is the King.
