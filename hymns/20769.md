# 20769 - MY HEAVEN, MY HOME

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I look away across the sea, Where mansions are prepared for me. And view the shining glory shore, My heav'n, my home forever more

### Verse 2

Then from Mount Pisgah's lofty height, I see my home and take my flight. This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise, To seize the everlasting prize.



### Verse 3

 I long to see my Savior on high; To meet someday up in the sky. His outreached hand, His open door; My heav'n, my home, forever more. I long to see my Savior on high; To meet someday up in the sky. His outreached hand, His open door; My heav'n, my home, forever more.

I long to see my Savior on high; To meet someday up in the sky. His outreached hand, His open door; My heav'n, my home, forever more
