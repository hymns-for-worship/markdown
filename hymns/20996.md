## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Away in a manger no crib for a bed, The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head; The stars in the sky looked down where He lay, The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

### Verse 2

The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes, But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes; I love Thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky, And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

### Verse 3

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray; Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care, And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there.
