## Notation

F - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Soul you are drifting along on the tide, Out on life's ocean so boundless and wide; Drifting away in the morning so bright, Where will you be when you anchor at night? 

### Verse 2

Drifting along with a smile and a song, Never once thinking that you might be wrong; Morning has changed to the noontide's red glare, Still you are drifting but answer me where? 

### Verse 3

Why are you drifting along as before, Tho'tlessly down to eternity's shore? Noonday has passed, comes the set of life's sun, Where are you now, when your drifting is done?

### Chorus

Drifting along, drifting along, Smile and a song, smile and a song, Drifting at night, drifting at night, In morning's light, in morning's light; Drifting away, drifting away, Breakers now roar, breakers now roar, Drifting today, From the beautiful golden shore.
