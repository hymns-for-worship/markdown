## Notation

Bb - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lay hold on the hope set before you, And let not a moment be lost, The Savior has purchased your ransom, But think what a price it hath cost.

### Verse 2

Lay hold on the hope set before you, Of life that you now may receive, If, gladly His mercy accepting, You truly repent and believe.

### Verse 3

Lay hold on the hope set before you, Of joy that no mortal can speak; It telleth of rest for the weary, Thru Jesus, the lowly and meek.


### Verse 4

Lay hold on the hope set before you, A hope that is steadfast and sure; O haste to the blessed Redeemer, The loving, the perfect and pure.


### Chorus

Lay hold on eternal salvation, Lay hold on the gift of Godâ€™s only Son; Lay hold on His infinite mercy, Lay hold on the Mighty One!
