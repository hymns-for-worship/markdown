## Lyrics

### Verse 1

From ev'ry stormy wind that blows, From ev'ry swelling tide of woes, There is a calm, a sure retreat; 'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

### Verse 2

There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads, A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood bought mercy seat. 

### Verse 3

There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend; Tho' sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.

### Verse 4

There, there on eagle's wings we soar, And sin and sense seem all no more, And heav'n comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.
