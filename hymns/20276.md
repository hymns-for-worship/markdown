## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As far as the East is from the West, as far as the worst is from the best, as far as the future's from the past, as far as the first is from the last

### Verse 2

As far as the heaven's from the earth, as far as the dying's from the birth, as far as the darkness from the light, as far as the blindness from the sight,

### Chorus

He is holy, I'm unworthy, He is faithful in all of His ways. He is worthy, I'm unholy. He has taken my sins away! And, O, how far He's taken my sins away from me.
