## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who will follow Jesus, standing for the right, holding up his banner in the thickest fight? Listening for his order, ready to obey, who will follow Jesus, serving him today?

### Verse 2

Who will follow Jesus, in life's busy way? Working for the master, giving him the praise; earnest in his vinyard, honoring his laws, faithful to his counsel, watchful for his cause.

### Verse 3

Who will follow Jesus in his work of love, leading others to him lifting prayers above? Courage! Faithful servant, in his word we see, on our side forever will the savior be.

### Chorus

Who will follow Jesus, who will make reply? I am on the Lord's side, master here am I. Who will follow Jesus, who will make reply? I am on the Lord's side! Master, here am I.
