## Notation

Db - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My name is in the Book of Life, O bless the name of Jesus! I rise above all doubt and strife, And read my title clear.

### Verse 2

My name once stood with sinners, lost, And bore a painful record; But by His blood the Savior cross'd, And placed it on His roll.



### Verse 3

Yet inward trouble often cast A shadow o'er my title; But now with full salvation blest, Praise God! it's ever clear. 

### Verse 4

While others climb thru worldly strife, To carve a name of honor, High up in heaven's Book of Life, My name is written there.



### Chorus

I know, I know my name is there; I know, I know my name is written there. I know, I truly know, I know my name is there; I know my name is there,
