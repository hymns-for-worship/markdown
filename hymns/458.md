# 458 - In The Garden

## Notation

Ab - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses; And the voice I hear, falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.

### Verse 2

 He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing; And the melody that He gave to me, Within my heart is ringing.

### Verse 3

 I'd stay in the garden with Him Tho' the night around me be falling; But He bids me go; thru the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling. 

### Chorus

And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own, And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.
