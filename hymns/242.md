# 242 - Only A Shadow Between

## Notation

F - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have a home in a fair summerland, its beauties I never have seen, I have a place on an evergreen strand, there's only a shadow between.

### Verse 2

Jesus has promised a home to prepare, thru faith on the promise I lean, I have a mansion that's wondrously fair, there's only a shadow between.

### Verse 3

When I have finished my task here below, I pass thru this shadowy screen, be with the ransomed forever I know, there's only a shadow between.

### Chorus

Only a shadow, a shadow between, only a shadow between, one step to go, o the way's all aglow, there's only a shadow between.
