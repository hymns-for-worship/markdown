## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When this passing world is done, When has sunk yon glaring sun, When I stand with Christ on high, Looking o'er life's history; In my life, Lord, be glorified, be glorified, In my life, Lord, be glorified today. Then, Lord, shall I fully know, Not 'til then how much I owe. 

### Verse 2

When I stand before the throne, Dressed in beauty not my own, When I see Thee as Thou art, Love Thee with unsining heart; E'en on earth, Lord, make me know, Something of how much I owe.

### Verse 3

When the praise of heav'n I hear, Loud as thunders to the ear, Loud as many wa-ters' noise, Sweet as harp's melodious voice; 

### Verse 4

E'en on earth, as thru a glass, Darkly let Thy glory pass; Make forgiveness feel so sweet, Make Thy Spirit's help so meet;
