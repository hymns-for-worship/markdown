### Verse 1

I may never march in the infantry, Ride in the Calvary, Shoot the artillery, I may never fly o'er the enemy, But I'm in the Lord's army.  Yes, Sir! I'm in the Lord's army. Yes Sir! I'm in the Lord's army. Yes, Sir! I may never march in the infantry, Ride in the Calvary, Shoot the artillery, I may never fly o'er the enemy, But I'm in the Lord's army. Yes Sir!
