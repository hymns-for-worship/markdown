## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my trials are deep, my blessed Lord I seek Thy great hand to lift me up. Keep me strong the whole day long. In Thy peace, O let me sleep; Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord. Lift me up, Let me stand In the face of Satan's hand; In my faith will I see Thy work so grand Grant to me the Spirit's guide; When in doubt, in Thee I'll hide Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord.

### Verse 2

As I walk trails of fear, my blessed Lord be near, For temptations are near by; Hold my hand, O hear my cry Yes, I know that I must try; Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord. Lift me up, Let me stand In the face of Satan's hand; In my faith will I see Thy work so grand Grant to me the Spirit's guide; When in doubt, in Thee I'll hide Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord.

### Verse 3

Angels coming for me to take me home with Thee When my earthly life is o'er. Hallelujah, praise Thy name; No more sorrow, no more pain. Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord. Lift me up, Let me stand In the face of Satan's hand; In my faith will I see Thy work so grand Grant to me the Spirit's guide; When in doubt, in Thee I'll hide Lift me up, Lift me up, my precious Lord.
