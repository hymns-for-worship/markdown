## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have met to eat Your supper, Lord, And I truly count the cost. O help me discern Your body now, As You died on Calvary's cross.

### Verse 2

Let  me see Your outstretched nailscarred hands,  And the thorns that made Your crown.  And the Roman sword that pierced Your side, Then Your life's blood flowed freely down. 

### Verse 3

Let me see that borrowed empty tomb. Risen Savior! King of Kings! As I eat believing  in Your word, My true worship now do I bring. 

### Verse 4

I believe thatYou will come again, And the saved ones You will reap. I will claim my final cleansing then, I will worship at Your dear feet.
