## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, for Thee all the follies of sin I resign; my gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou; If ever I love Thee, my Jesus tis now.

### Verse 2

I love Thee, because Thou has first loved me, and purchased my pardon on calvary's tree; I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow; If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus tis now.

### Verse 3

I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death, and praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath; and say when the death dew lies cold on my brow; If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus tis now.

### Verse 4

In masions of glory and endless delight, I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright; I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow; If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus tis now.
