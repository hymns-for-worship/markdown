## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart, draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art; fold me, o fold me close to Thy breast, shelter me safe in that haven of rest, shelter me safe in that haven of rest.

### Verse 2

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring, not as an offring to Jesus my King; only my sinful, now contrite heart, grant me the cleansing Thy blood does impart, grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

### Verse 3

Nearer, still nearer, Lord to be Thine, sin with its follies I gladly resign; all of its pleasures, pomp, and its pride, give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified, give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

### Verse 4

Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last, till safe in glory, my anchor is cast; thro endless ages, ever to be, nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee, nearer my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
