## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God Himself is with us! Let us now adore Him, And with awe appear before Him. God is in His temple, All within keep silence, And before Him bow with rev'rence. Him alone, God we own; To our Lord and Savior Praises sing forever.

### Verse 2

God Himself is with us: Whom angelic legions Serve with awe in heav'nly regions. "Holy, Holy, Holy," Sing the hosts of heaven, Praise to God be ever given. Bow Thy ear To us here;
Hear, O Christ, the praises That Thy church now raises.

### Verse 3

O Thou fount of blessing, Purify my spirit; Trusting only in Thy merit, Like the holy angels, Who behold Thy glory, May I ceaselessly adore Thee. And in all, Great and small, Seek to do most nearly What Thou lovest dearly.
