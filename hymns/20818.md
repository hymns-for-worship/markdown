# 20818 - LITTLE IS MUCH, WHEN GOD IS IN IT

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In the harvest field now ripened, There's a work for all to do; Hark, the voice of God is calling, To the harvest calling you.

### Verse 2

Does the place you're called to labor Seem so small and little known? It is great if God is in it, And He'll not forget His own.

### Verse 3

When the conflict here is ended And our race on earth is run; He will say, if we are faithful, "Welcome home, my child, well done."

### Chorus

Little is much when God is  in it, Labor not for wealth or fame; There's a crown and you can win it, If you go in Jesus name.
