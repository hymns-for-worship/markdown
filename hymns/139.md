## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Into the heart of Jesus, deeper and deeper I go, seeking to know the reason why He should love me so, why he should stoop to lift me up from the miry clay, saving my soul, making me whole, tho I had wandered away.

### Verse 2

Into the heart of Jesus, deeper and deeper I go, praying for grace to follow, seeking His way to know, bowing in full surrender low at His blessed feet, bidding Him take, bread me and make, till I am molded and meet.

### Verse 3

Into the heart of Jesus, deeper and deeper I go, following thro the garden facing the dreaded foe, drinking the cup of sorrow, sobbing with broken heart: "o Savior, help! Dear Savior, help! Grace for my weakness impart."

### Verse 4

Into the heart of Jesus, deeper and deeper I go, rising with soul enraptured far from the world below, joy in the place of sorrows, peace in the midst of pain, Jesus will give, Jesus will give; He will uphold and sustain.
