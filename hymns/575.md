## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O Lord, help us remember, As we these emblems take, Your suff'ring death on Calv'ry, For our unworthy sakes.

### Verse 2

 O Lord, help us remember, The crown of thorns You wore; Altho' Your vision bloodstained, Your love divine outpoured.

### Verse 3

 O Lord, help us remember That from death You arose; The pow'r of God did raise You Triumphant o'er Your foes.

### Verse 4

 O Lord, help us remember You are at God's right hand; This feast reveals Your suff'ring Until You come again.
