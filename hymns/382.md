## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In heav'nly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear; And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here. The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid, But God is 'round about me, And can I be dismayed? dismayed. (I be)

### Verse 2

 Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back; My Shepherd is beside me, And nothing can I lack.  His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim; He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him. (will walk)

### Verse 3

 Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen; Bright skies will soon be o'er me, Where the dark clouds have been. My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free; My Savior has my treasure, And He will walk with me. (will walk)
