## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Must I go, and  empty handed, Thus my dear Redemer meet! Not one day of service give Him, Lay no trophy at His feet?

### Verse 2

O the years in sinnng wasted, Could I but recall them now, I would give them to my Savior, To His will I'd gladly bow.

### Verse 3

O ye saints, arouse, be earnest, Up and work while yet 'tis day; Ere the night of death o'ertake thee, Strvie for souls while still you may.

### Chorus

Must I go, and empty handed? Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him; Must I empty handed go?
