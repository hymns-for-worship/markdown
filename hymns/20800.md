## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I don't know about tomorrow, I just live from day to day; I don't borrow from its sunshine, For its skies may turn to gray; I don't worry o'er the future,  For I know what Jesus said, And today I'll walk beside Him, For He knows what is ahead.

### Verse 2

Ev'ry step is getting brighter As the golden stairs I climb; Ev'ry burden's getting lighter, Ev'ry cloud is sliver lined. There the sun is always shining, There no tear will dim the eye; At the ending of the rainbow, Where the mountains touch the sky.

### Verse 3

I don't know about tomorrow, It may bring me poverty; But the One who feeds the sparrow Is the One who stands by me; And the path that be my portion. May be thru the flame or flood, But His presence goes before me,And I'm covered with His blood.

### Chorus

Many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand; But I know Who holds tomorrow, And I know Who holds my hand.
