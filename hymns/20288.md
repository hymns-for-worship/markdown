## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A broken spirit and a contrite heart; You will not despise, You will not despise. You desire truth in the inward parts, a broken spirit and a contrite heart. Lord, my heart is prone to wander, prone to leave the God I love; Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it for Your courts above.
