## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was crucified, Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary!

### Verse 2

 By God's word at last my sin I learned; Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned, Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary!

### Verse 3

 Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything; Now I gladly own Him as my King, Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary! 

### Verse 4

 O, the love that drew salvation's plan! O, the grace that bro't it down to man! O, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!

### Chorus

Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty, At Calvary.
