## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When in glory Jesus comes, with a mighty angel band; Then before His judgment throne, calls each one from ev'ry land. Tho' He shed His precious blood, for all men prepared the way; Souls who live for self and sin, then must hear the Savior say:

### Verse 2

If God's mercy you refuse, Home with Him you'll never know; With the devil you must stay, in that place of fire and woe. If you're tired of sin today, come to Christ, His will obey; Then the vict'ry may be won: joy and peace and endless day.

### Chorus

Depart from Me, "Depart from me." O how sad it would be not to hear, "Oh come you blest, enter into heaven's rest," But the sentence then would be O soul, "Depart from Me!"
