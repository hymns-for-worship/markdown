## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There is a name I love to hear, I love to sing its worth; It sounds like mu-sic in mine ear, The sweet-est name on earth.

### Verse 2

 It tells me of a Savior's love, Who died to set me free; It tells me of His precious blood, The sinner's perfect plea.

### Verse 3

 It tells of One whose loving heart Can feel my deepest woe; Who in each sorrow bears a part, That none can bear below.

### Chorus

O, how I love Jesus, O, how I love Jesus, O, how I love Jesus, Because He first loved me.
