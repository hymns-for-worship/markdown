## Notation

Em - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Consider the mornings of this mortal land, Each a new beginning from the Maker's hand. While the storms may gather 'gainst the evening sky, The day breaks cloudless in the morning.

### Verse 2

Rise up to the battle, for the skies dawn clear. Let us gather courage while the foe draws near. Though the night falls weary, saints of God, march on! And He'll raise our banner in the morning.

### Verse 3

When the trumpet sounds to signal Heaven's day, Resurrection Morning when the dead shall wake, What a glorious gath'ring when the Lord descends And we rise to meet him in the morning.

### Chorus

How long, my Lord? Till we see the morning? How long, O, my Lord, till we see your face? O my Lord, guide us through our troubles till we rise above them in the morning.
