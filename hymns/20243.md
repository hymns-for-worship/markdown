## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be not afraid for I will always be with thee, Across the waves these words of Christ are laid; In tempest wild they still reach out to rescue me, "Lo, it is I, so do not be afraid."

### Verse 2

Mid swelling tide I sink into the tempter's sea; Strong winds of doubt have made my heart dismayed; With patient care His words remind me tenderly, Increase thy faith and "do not be afraid."

### Verse 3

From angry waves His words of life have set me free; A heav'nly hope, A peaceful calm has made. O'er depths of death His arm will safely carry me; One final storm, I will not be afraid.
