# 1056 - Where Could I Go

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Living below in this old sinful world, Comfort I get from God's own word; Striving alone to face temptations sore, Where could I go but to the Lord? 

### Verse 2

Neighbors are kind, I love them ev'ry one, We get along in sweet accord; But when my soul needs manna from above, Where could I go but to the Lord.

### Verse 3

Life here is grand and friends I love so dear, Comfort I get from God's own word; Yet when I face the chilling hand of death, Where could I go but to the Lord.

### Chorus

Where could I go, O where could I go, Seeking a comfort for my soul? Needing a friend to save me in the end, Where could I go but to the Lord?
