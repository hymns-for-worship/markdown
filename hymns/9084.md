## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Lord saith, "I'll leave you but I'll come again, I'll come and I'll gather to Me all My own." Inspiring my gladness, my love, my refrain. I'll sing that old story that I've known so long.

### Verse 2

It may be in winter or summer or fall, Or when the new flowers feel warm breezes blow. But I must be list'ning and when Jesus calls, I'll fly away yonder, where life's water flow.

### Verse 3

It may be at sunrise with frost in the air, Or evening with skies glowing wondrously fair. E'en so, with such beauty that I love so dear, My soul longs for heaven, my loved ones are there.

### Verse 4

Yes, I must be ready, for soon I shall see My Savior descending from high up above. And that wil be glory, yes, glory for me, To be with my Jesus, Messiah of love.
