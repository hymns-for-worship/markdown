## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Go, in early morning into the harvest white, Sing a song of gladness labor with all your might; Let the words of Jesus over the nation ring, With the coming evening beautiful gleanings bring.

### Verse 2

For the faint and weary, carry a smile of cheer, With the sad and dreary, weeping an anxious tear; To the heart that's aching under a load of care, Lend a hand of comfort, cover its ailings there.

### Verse 3

In the name of Jesus, gather the sheaves today, Read the percious promise, wages, He you will pay; Go with great rejoicing gleaning from fields of sin,  Thrust thy glowing sickle, bringing the harvest in. 

### Chorus

See the beautiful harvest white! Go, and labor with all your might; Let your anthems of gladness ring, Go, and beautiful gleanings bring!

### Coda

See the beautiful harvest white! Go, and labor with all your might; Let your anthems of gladness ring, Go, and beautiful gleanings bring!
