# 671 - He Carried My Sorrows

## Notation

Eb - 12/8 on 9 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 He carried my sorrows, He bore my griefs, Was pierced for transgressions, afflicted for peace.

### Verse 2

 He suffered in anguish, He writhed in pain, Was smitten, forsaken, abandoned and slain.

### Verse 3

 Despised and rejected, He knew no sin, Was crushed for His people, no violence within. 

### Verse 4

 My heart mourns His chast'ning, My tears still fall, My sin is the reason He gave me His all.

### Chorus

He knew by His stripes I am healed, thru His blood I can kneel, For by His oppression, I worship my King.
