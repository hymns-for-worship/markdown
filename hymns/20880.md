# 20880 - NOW MY SPIRIT SOARS

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There were times in my life when I searched thru my soul and longed for the meaning of life; Needed strength and release from my burden of cares, Release from all my worry and my strife.

### Verse 2

When I opened my eyes, let my heart see the way that leads to the heavens above; then my hunger was filled and my thirsting was quenched, I breathed new life as I obeyed His will.

### Chorus

Now my spirit soars as high as an eagle in the sky; My Lord restored the hope in my soul. I see in His Word all I need in my life; The power of His grace that makes me whole.
