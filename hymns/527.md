## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 By faith I see Mount Calvary, By faith I see that cruel tree; I see His pain, I see His strife, By faith I see my ransomed life. 

### Verse 2

 In awe I see His flesh so torn, In awe I see the peoples' scorn; God turns away, I hear His plea, In awe I see His love for me. 

### Verse 3

 Thru tears I see that perfect blood; Thru tears I see that blessed flood; He cries, "'Tis done!"; the battle's o'er, Thru tears He sees my sins no more.
