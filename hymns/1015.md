## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Known before the world; (Seen in future days;) Glimpsed by righteous men; Son of God. Sent as David's heir; (Named an ageless king;) Granted all the earth. Exalted.

### Verse 2

Seen with blinded eyes; (Heard by heedless ears;) Met with wicked hearts; Son of God. Worshipped with contempt; (Crowned with blood and thorns;) Throned upon a cross. Exalted.

### Verse 3

Scorned by those who watched; (Mocked by all the wise;) Loved within belief; Son of God. Born to take my death; (Slain to give me life;) Jesus, Son of God. Exalted. Exalted.
