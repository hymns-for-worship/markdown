## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Eternal Creator,our faithful true Friend; Compassion and justice and mercy He blends. All wise and Omnipotent all present One; And He Is our Savior thru His own dear Son.

### Verse 2

His love and His mercy, His grace we do see; So kind and exaled, forgiving is He. Impartial in judgment, and true righteousness; God's wrath is on evil, the good He will bless.

### Chorus

How awesome the God we adore; The great "I AM THAT I AM." His glory and praise our voices should raise; His grandeur to magnify!
