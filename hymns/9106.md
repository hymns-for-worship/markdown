## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, what glimpse of wonder Once blessed the prophet's eyes, When You drew near the river And asked to be baptized? No king who deigned to travel Where lesser feet had trod; The Baptist saw a servant And cried, "The Lamb of God!"

### Verse 2

For tho' You were the highest, You made no lofty claim, Nor grasped at ancient title, Nor boasted in Your name. You let Yourself be emptied, To dwell as man with men, Your life, the perfect off'ring For enmity and sin.

### Verse 3

May we, reborn of Spirit, Of water and of blood, Be seen as You were witnessed Beside the Jordan Flood. May we in humble service Your service thus proclaim, That all who watch may see You And cry aloud Your name.

### Coda

Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Behold the Lamb of God!
