## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A coat of many colors worn by a favored son. His brothers thought to kill him, They stained his coat with blood. Yet his heart was allforgiving: "God meant it for good." The son released from prison, by Pharoah's throne he stood.


### Verse 2

A coat, seamless woven, worn by His only Son. His brothers sought to kill Him, His coat was stained with blood. Yet His heart was allforgiving: "God meant it for good." The Son returned from prison and by God's throne He stood.

### Chorus

"God meant it for good" when I could not see. He meant it for good preserving life for me. How awesome to see His wondrous plan to save, and know without a doubt "God meant it for good."

### Coda

"God meant it for good" when I could not see. He meant it for good preserving life for me. How awesome to see His wondrous plan to save, and know without a doubt "God meant it for good."
