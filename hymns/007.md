## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is none like Him; none can compare; no god His equal, no prince His heir!

### Verse 2

Have you not known Him? Have you not heard? God is Creator of all the earth.

### Verse 3

Some will grow weary; sin they'll pursue. Servants of God their pow'r He'll renew.

### Chorus

Lift up your eyes and see His great might! Soar like an eagle, on wings of flight! Saints, lift your voices, tho' dark your days! Lift up your spirits, sing out His praise! Upward the calling, brighter the light! Soaring like eagles, on wings of flight.
