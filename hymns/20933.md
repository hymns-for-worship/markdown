## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended, The darkness falls at Thy behest; To Thee our morning hymns ascended: Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.

### Verse 2

We thank Thee that Thy Church, unsleeping, While earth rolls onward into light, Thru all the world her watch is keeping, And rests not now by day or night.

### Verse 3

The sun that bids us rest is waking Our brethren 'neath the western sky; And hour by hour fresh lips are making Thy wondrous doings heard on high.

### Verse 4

So, be it, Lord: Thy throne shall never, Like earth's proud empires, pass away; But stand and rule and grow for ever, Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
