### Verse 1

I cannot go on in this dark world at all Without the sure help of my Savior; For when I am weak it is then I recall My Lord's true and loving favor:

### Verse 2

In this world of sin often trials I meet With worries and burdens distressing, But in Christ there's power to make me complete; With joy I proclaim this blessing:

### Chorus

His grace is sufficient for me, In weakness His power I see; With strength from above I'll live faithfully; His grace is sufficient for me.
