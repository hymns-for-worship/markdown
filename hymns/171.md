## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When we meet in sweet communion, while the feast divine is spread; hearts are brot in closer union while partaking of the bread.

### Verse 2

God so loved what wondrous measure! Loved and gave the best of heav'n; bought us with the matchless treasure, yea, for us his life is giv'n.

### Verse 3

Feast divine all else surpassing, precious blood for you and me; while we sup Christ gently whispers: "do this in my memory."

### Chorus

Precious feast, all else surpassing, wondrous love for you and me; while we feast Christ gently whispers: "do this in my memory."
