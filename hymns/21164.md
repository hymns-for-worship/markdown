## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Now is the time for all mankind to hear, God's precious Gospel, the truth to believe. God gave His Son for remission of sins. Come hear, believe, and the Savior receive.

### Verse 2

Do not delay, come repent of your sins. Confess that Jesus is Christ, God's dear Son. No greater love has forever been shown. Come and be Christlike, unite and be one.

### Verse 3

Obey the Lord and be baptized today. Live as a Christian before it's too late. He'll give you hope, life eternal with Him. Come hear Him say, "Enter in," at life's gate.

### Chorus

Now is the time, be wise. Don't wait another day. Jesus will come again, to receive His own.
