## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy, Weak and wounded, sick and sore; Jesus ready stands to save you, Full of pity, love and pow'r. Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome, God's free bounty glorify; True belief and true repentance, Ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.

### Verse 2

Come, ye weary, heavy laden, Lost and ruined by the fall; If you tarry till you're better, You will never come at all. View Him prostrate in the garden; On the ground your maker lies. On the bloody tree behold Him; Sinner, will this not suffice?

### Verse 3

Come, ye weary, heavy laden, Lost and ruined by the fall; If you tarry till you're better, You will never come at all. View Him prostrate in the garden; On the ground your maker lies. On the bloody tree behold Him; Sinner, will this not suffice?
