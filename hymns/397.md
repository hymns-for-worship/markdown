## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Ye soldiers of the cross; Lift high His royal banner, It must not suffer loss; From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead, Till ev'ry foe is vanquished And Christ is Lord indeed. 

### Verse 2

 Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The trumpet call obey; Forth to the mighty conflict, In this His glorious day; Ye that are men now serve Him, Against unnumbered foes; Your courage rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose.

### Verse 3

 Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Stand in His strength alone; The arm of flesh will fail you, Ye dare not trust your own; Put on the gospel armor, Each piece put on with pray'r; Where duty calls, or danger, Be never wanting there.

### Verse 4

 Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The strife will not be long; This day the noise of battle, The next the victor's song; To him that overcometh, A crown of life shall be; He with the King of glory Shall live eternally.
