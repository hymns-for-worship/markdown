## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Father, guide my wayward soul And teach me how to pray, For when I need your care the most, I often turn away.

### Verse 2

The sins and woes that plague my flesh Corrupt my spirit, too. They scatter doubt within my heart And take me far from you.

### Verse 3

So help me, Lord, when I depart, To turn again to prayer, That I may both receive Your love And see You in Your care.

### Amen

Amen
