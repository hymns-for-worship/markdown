## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, pilgrim thru this barren land; I am weak, but Thou art mighty, hold me with they powerful hand; bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more: bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.

### Verse 2

Open now the crystal fountain, whence the healing waters flow; let the fiery, cloudy pillar, lead me all my journey thru; strong deliverer, be Thou still my strength and sheild; strong deliverer, be Thou still my strength and shield.

### Verse 3

When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious fears subside; bear me thru the swelling current, land me safe on Canaan's side; songs of praises I will ever give to Thee; songs of praises, I will ever give to Thee.
