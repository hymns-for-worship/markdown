## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O think of a home over there, By the side of the river of light, Where the saints all immortal and fair Are robed in their garments of white. Over there, ever there, O think of the home ever there , over there, over there, over there, O think of a home over there. 

### Verse 2

O think of the saints over there, Who before us the journey have trod, Of the songs that they breathe on the aire, In there homes in the palace of God. over there, Over there, O think of the home Over there  over there, over there, over there,  0 think of the saints over there. 

### Verse 3

I'll soon be at home over there, For the end of my journey I see; All the saints and the angels up there Are watching and waiting for me. Over there, ever there, I'll soon be at home over there, Over there, over there, over there,  I'll soon be at home over there.
