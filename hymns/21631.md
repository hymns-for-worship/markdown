## Lyrics

### Verse 1

If outside the Lord I be, Far from Him who died for me, Wand'ring in iniquity, Is no life at all.



### Verse 2

If I die without the Lord, Hopeless, helpless, all forlorn, What awaits forevermore, Is no life at all.


### Verse 3

Ah, but if I live for Him, Who has made me free from sin, When my life on earth shall end, Is no death at all.

### Verse 4

 Life or death, which shall it be? Life or death, which choice for me? Choosing life, eternally, This shall be my all.
