## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive our foolish ways; reclothe us in our rightful mind, in purer lives Thy service find, in deeper rev'rence, praise.

### Verse 2

In simple trust like theirs who heard, beside the Syrian sea, the gracious calling of the Lord, let us, like them, without a word rise up and follow Thee.

### Verse 3

O Sabbath rest by Galilee, o calm of hills above, where Jesus knelt to share with Thee the silence of eternity, interpreted by love!

### Verse 4

Drop Thy still dews of quietness, till all our strivings cease; take from our souls the strain and stress, and let our ordered lives confess the beauty of Thy peace.
