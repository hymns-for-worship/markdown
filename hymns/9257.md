## Notation

Eb - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christian virtues, they are so precious, we must have them, thus saith His word We must follow ev'ry day live them, or displease our Savior and Lord.

### Verse 2

To our faith, Lord, help us add virtue, knowledge gained by loving Thy word; Temp'rance, patience, godliness follow, brotherly kindness mingled with love.

### Verse 3

When these things are ever increasing, we are fruitful rather than blind. Let us practice, and never stumble, with our Savior foremost in mind.

### Chorus

Help us, Father, ever grow stronger. Turn our lives away from sin. Let us shirk our duty no longer, Help us grow by following Him.
