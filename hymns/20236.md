## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon the throne; Hark, how the heavn'ly anthem drowns All music but its own! Awake, my soul, and sing Of Him who died for thee, And hail Him as they matchless King Thru all eternity.

### Verse 2

Crown Him the Lord of life, Who triumphed o'er the grave, Who rose victorious in the strife For those He came to save! His glories now we sing, Who died and rose on high, Who died eternal life to bring, And lives that death may die.

### Verse 3

Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose pow'r a scepter sways From pole to pole, that wars may cease, Absorbed in prayer and praise: His reign shall know no end, And round His pierced feet Fair flow'rs of Paradise extend, Their fragrance ever sweet.

### Verse 4

Crown Him the Lord of heav'n, One with the Father known, And the blest Spirit, thru Him giv'n From yonder glorious throne! All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail Thru-out eternity.
