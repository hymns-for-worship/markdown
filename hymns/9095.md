## Lyrics

### Verse 1

For Christ and the Church we voice our love, For Truth and for Right we stand; Thru faith in the Lord we look above, And hold to the Savior's hand.

### Verse 2

The banner of Truth waves high above, The light of the cross leads on. The voice of the King rings out in love, Be true till the crown is won.

### Verse 3

For Christ and the Church we plead in song: All praise unto Him once slain! To the heavenly home we press along, And join in a glad refrain.
