## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Give me a kind, forgiving heart. Let pardon be my goal. May no grudge enter in my heart to take control.

### Verse 2

Give me a sweet and gentle tongue. Let kindness be my song. Keep me from words that wound and keep my tongue from wrong.

### Verse 3

Give me a soul that yearns for truth, Hungering for Thy word. Help me to share the greatest story ever heard.

Give me a heart that longs for peace, With other men and Thee. Help me to know that peace must first begin with me.
