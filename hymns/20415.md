## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O soul of mine, be not alarmed At what the Lord may say, Some future time, when I am old, I'll choose the heav'nly way. Time, time, time enough yet, O soul, why be alarmed? The heavenly way I'll choose some day, But there's time, time enough yet!

### Verse 2

I'm strong enough, I need no help, It's pleasure that I crave; When I have drunk life's sparkling cup, I'll call on Christ to save. Time, time, time enough yet, O soul, why be alarmed? The heavenly way I'll choose some day, But there's time, time enough yet!

### Verse 3

The Holy Spirit's tender voice Entreats me night and day, And ere I go in sin too far I'll turn and Him obey. Time, time, time enough yet, O soul, why be alarmed? The heavenly way I'll choose some day, But there's time, time enough yet!

### Verse 4

Today, O friend, may be the last, Stop now and count the cost; You stand condemned before the throne, Your soul forever lost.  Lost! Lost! O what a cry From souls along the shore; In darkness to go, In sorrow and woe, And be lost, lost evermore!
