## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I lay my sins on Jesus, the spotless Lamb of God; He bears them all and frees us from the accursed load. I bring my guilt to Jesus, to wash my crimson stains Clean in His blood most precious, till not a spot remains.


### Verse 2

I lay my needs on Jesus; all fullness dwells in Him; He heals all my diseases; my soul He does redeem. I lay my griefs on Jesus, my burdens and my cares; He from them all releases; He all my sorrows shares.

### Verse 3

I long to be like Jesus– meek, loving, lowly, mild; I long to be like Jesus– the Father's holy Child. I long to be with Jesus, amid the heav'nly throng, To sing with saints His praises, to learn the angel's song.
