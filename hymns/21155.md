## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Wherever I may travel, Wherever I may roam, I know with Christ beside me I'll always feel at home; And if the day be shadowed, Or if the sky be gray, I know that if He guides me I'll never lose my way.

### Verse 2

The voice that stilled the waters Is speaking in my ear, It tells me just to follow And never, never fear; Upon the highest mountain, Or in the valley low, The hand that made the heavens Is with me where I go.

### Chorus

I walk with His hand in mine, For each day's a stranger to me; I'll kneel down and pray At each dawn of day, And ask Him to care for me. I know not the way to go, I only know He loves me so; In sorrow and care I know He'll be there, As I walk with His hand in mine.
