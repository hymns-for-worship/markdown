## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Jesus gave His life a ransom yonder on Calvary, On Mount Calvary, cruel Calvary; Paved the way by blood that we might win a bright shining crown,

### Verse 2

 All alone without a friend He suffered to pay it all, Yes, He paid it all, Jesus paid it all; In His blessed promises sweet victory can be found,

### Chorus

Praise His blessed holy name salvation has been bro't down, O glory, Praise the Lord salvation has been bro't down Go and shout and tell it the world around, Tell it today, to people in sorrow, tell it today, and tell it tomorrow, Preach the word of God that we might win a shining crown in heaven, Tell the lost, salvation is full and fee, Spread the news all over the land and sea. Tell it afar, in every nation, tell it afar all over creation, Praise the Lord, salvation has been bro't down. 

### Verse 3

 There's a blessed home prepared 'way over in gloryland, In bright gloryland, blessed gloryland; I have trusted in His love and now I am heaven bound,
