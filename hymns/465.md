### Verse 1

 When the road is rough and the way is dim, Jesus knows, Jesus cares; When the darkness comes we can go to Him, Jesus knows, Jesus cares.

### Verse 2

 When the heart is sad over one untrue, Jesus knows, Jesus cares; Go to Him in prayer, He will strengthen you, Jesus knows, Jesus cares.

### Verse 3

 When you say goodbye to your dearest friend, Jesus knows, Jesus cares; He will comfort you until life shall end, Jesus knows, Jesus cares.

He knows from His throne above; He cares with a perfect love! Go to Jesus for peace, go to Him for rest; He sees it all O yes, He cares
