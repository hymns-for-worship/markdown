## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The world all about me has now no allure: It's pleasures bring pain, It's wisdom is vain; I seek a foundation that's steadfast and sure: 

### Verse 2

The Lord Jesus died my salvation to win: He went in my stead To Calv'ry and bled; Redemption impels me to give up all sin: I'll put Jesus first in my life.

### Verse 3

I know there's a home for the ransomed and blest, When death is no more, When struggle is o'er, For those who love Jesus and give Him their best: I'll put Jesus first in my life.

### Verse 4

Tho' earth's tribulations continue each day, Tho' pleasures may call, Tho' evil enthrall, His grace will protect me forever and aye: I'll put Jesus first in my life.

### Chorus

In all that I say, In all that I do, Thruout the world of toil and strife, By day and by night, Thru trust in His might, I'll put Jesus first in my life. I'll put Jesus first in my life.
