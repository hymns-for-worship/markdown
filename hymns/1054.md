Rest of the weary, Joy of the sad, Hope of the dreary, Light of the glad; Refuge from danger, Strength to the end, Home of the stranger, Savior and Friend.

### Verse 2

Wealth of the giving, Heart of the kind, Breath of the living, Sight of the blind; Path of the lowly, Crown at the end, Bread of the holy, Savior and Friend.

Song of the sighing, Lamp of the led, Prayer of the dying, Life of the dead; Be my endeavor, Unto the end, Love me forever, Savior and Friend.
