### Verse 1

Prince of peace! Control my will, bid this struggling heart be still; bid my fears and doubtings cease hush my spirit into peace.

### Verse 2

Thou hast bo't me with thy blood, opened wide the gate of God; peace I ask, but peace must be, Lord, in being one with Thee.

### Verse 3

May Thy will, not mine, be done; may Thy will and mine be one; chase these doubtings from my heart; now Thy perfect peace impart.

### Verse 4

Savior, at Thy feet I fall; thou my life, my God, my all; let Thy happy servant be one forevermore with Thee. 

### Coda

Amen.
