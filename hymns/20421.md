## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Far away the noise of strife Upon my ear is falling, Then I know the sins of earth Beset on ev'ry hand; Doubt and fear and things of earth In vain to me are calling, None of these shall move me From Beulah Land.

### Verse 2

Far below the storm of doubt Upon the world is beating, Sons of men in battle long The enemy withstand; Safe am I within the castle Of God's Word retreating, Nothing then can reach me 'Tis Beulah Land.

### Verse 3

Let the stormy breezes blow, Their cry cannot alarm me, I am safely sheltered here, Protected by God's hand; Here the sun is always shining Here there's naught can harm me, I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

### Verse 4

Viewing here the works of God, I sink in cotemplation, Hearing now his blessed voice, I see the way He planned; Dwelling in the Spirit, Here I learn of full salvation, Gladly will I tarrry In Beulah Land.

### Chorus

I'm living on the mountain, Underneath a cloudless sky, Paise God! I'm drinking at the fountain That never shall run dry; O yes, I'm feasting on the manna From a bountiful supply, For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
