# 21036 - I LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED ME

## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ Jesus my Lord from heaven came, To save me from guilt and sin and shame; His death on the cross of Calvary, Bro't pardon and gave me liberty. 

### Verse 2

He sweat drops as blood in pray'r for me, Heartbroken in dark Gethsemane, While angels from blessed realms of light Gave strength to His aching heart that night.

### Verse 3

Up Calvary's hill the cross He bore, And for me a crown of thorns He wore; They nailed Him upon the tree to die, Then darkness came over earth and sky.

### Verse 4

My Lord who was slain by sinful man, A wonderful friend to me has been; He rose from the tomb with victory, And now I love Him as He loves me.


### Chorus

I love Him because He first loved me, He first loved me, He first loved me; I love Him because He first loved me, And died on the cross of Calvary.
