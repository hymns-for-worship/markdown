## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The King shall come when morning dawns And light triumphant breaks; When beauty gilds the eastern hills And life to joy awakes.

### Verse 2

Not as of old a little child To bear, and fight, and die. But crowned with glory like the sun That lights the morning sky.

### Verse 3

O brighter than the rising morn When He, victorious, rose And left the lonesome place of death, Despite the rage of foes. 

### Verse 4

O brighter than that glorious morn Shall this fair morning be When Christ our King in beauty comes And we His face shall see.

### Verse 5

And let the endless bliss begin, by weary saints foretold, when right shall triumph over wrong, and truth shall be extolled. 

### Verse 6

The King shall come when morning dawns, and light and beauty brings; "Hail, Christ the Lord!" Thy people pray, "Come quickly, King of kings!"
