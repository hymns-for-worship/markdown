## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As the deer pants for the water so my soul longs after You. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship You. 

### Verse 2

 I want You more than gold or silver, only You can satisfy. You alone are the real joygiver, and the apple of my eye. 

### Chorus

You alone are my strength, my shield; to You alone may my spirit yield.  You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship You.
