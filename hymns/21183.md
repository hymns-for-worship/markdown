## Notation

Bb - 6/4 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We may tarry a while here as strangers, Unnoticed by those who pass by; But the Savior will crown us in glory, To shine as the stars in the sky.

### Verse 2

We may never be rich in earth's treasures, Nor rise on the ladder of fame; But the saints will at last be rewarded, Made rich in Immanuel's name.

### Verse 3

We may live in a tent or a cottage, And die in seclusion alone; But the Father, who seeth in secret, Remembers each one of His own.

### Chorus

We shall shine as the stars of the morning, With Jesus the Crucified One; We shall rise to be like Him forever, Eternally shine as the sun.
