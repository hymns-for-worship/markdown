# 237 - Let The Lower Lights Be Burning

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Brightly beams our father's mercies from the lighthouse evermore; but to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.

### Verse 2

Dark the night of sin has settled, loud the angry billows roar; eager eyes are watching, longing, for the lights along the shore.

### Verse 3

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother; some poor seaman temest tossed, trying now to make the harbor, in the darkness may be lost.

### Chorus

Let your lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave! Some poor fainting, struggling seaman, you may rescue, you may save.\
