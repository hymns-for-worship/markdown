## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Come, let us all unite to sing, God is love; Let heav'n and earth their praises bring, God is love; Let ev'ry soul from sin awake, Each in his heart sweet music make, And sing with us for Jesus' sake, For God is love.

### Verse 2

 O, tell to earth's remotest bound, God is love; In Christ we have redemption found, God is love; His blood has washed our sins away, His Spirit turned our night to day, And now we can rejoice to say, That God is love.

### Verse 3

 How happy is our portion here, God is love; His promises our spirits cheer, God is love; He is our sun and shield by day, Our help, our hope, our strength and stay, He will be with us all the way, Our God is love. 

### Chorus

God is love! God is love! Come, let us all unite to sing  That God is love.
