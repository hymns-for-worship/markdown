## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When the Savior comes for His chosen ones, When the bright day breaks and the dead awakes; 

### Verse 2

 Let the message ring over hill and plain, Send it far and wide on the gospel tide; 

### Verse 3

 He's the One we love, He's the One we prove, He's the One who cheers thru the weary years; 

### Verse 4

 Tho' He tarry long, this will be our song, Tho' the path be dim, we will cling to Him; We'll be like Him when He comes.

### Chorus

We'll be like Him, sing the glad refrain; We'll be like Him when He comes again, Blessed thought to me that His face I'll see, And be like Him when He comes.
