## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 As I journey thru the land singing as I go, Pointing souls to Calvary, to the crimson flow; Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within, But my Lord leads me on, thru Him I must win.

### Verse 2

 When in service for my Lord dark may be the night, But I'll cling more close to Him, He will give me light; Satan's snares may vex my soul, turn my tho'ts aside, But my Lord goes ahead, leads whate'er betide. O I 

### Verse 3

 When in valleys low I look t'ward the mountain height, And behold my Savior there, leading in the fight; With a tender hand outstretched t'ward the valleys low, Guiding me, I can see, as I onward go. 

### Chorus

O I want to see Him, look upon His face, There to sing forever of His saving grace; On the streets of glory let me lift my voice, Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.
