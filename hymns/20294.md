## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It is in giving that we receive, It is in pard'ning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Make me an instrument of Your peace, I want to know what it's like to follow You. When men look at me, I want them to see, The light of the world inside.
