 Teach your children! Love your children! Train them in the way of God. What a sweet reunion there will be in our home eternally.

 Precious gifts that come from God, Our dear children whom we love. What a blessed privilege we have, Molding hearts for heav'n above.

 Fathers you must lead the way, Dai  ly teach and with them pray. And the mothers too, with tender hand, Kindly guide them lest they stray.

 Sweetest home Christ has prepared Where no tear will dim our eye. And our faithful loved ones there can sing Grateful praise to God on high.
