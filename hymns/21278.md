## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Don't cry for me when you see that I'm missing, I'm finally on my way home; My blessed Lord will be waiting to greet me, From His arms I'll never roam.

### Verse 2

I'll take my flight to that gloryland city, I'll sing and shout evermore; Homecoming day will be worth all the waiting, I am ready now to soar.

### Chorus

Yes, I will rise and join all the saints gone on before, I'll sing up there and praise Him for aye; The greatest joy will be Jesus to love and adore, Yes, it will be a great homecoming day.
