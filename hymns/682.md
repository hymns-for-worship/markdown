## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 It thrills my soul to hear the songs of praise, We mortals sing below, And tho' it takes the parting of the ways, Yet I must onward go; I hope to hear thruout unnumbered days, The song earth cannot know, 

### Verse 2

 The greatest joy that I have ever known, Is praising Him in song, I know some day when I have older grown, My voice will not be strong; But if good seed for Jesus I have sown, With angels I'll belong,

### Verse 3

 The sweetest song that earth can ever boast, Was sung when Christ was born, Yet He who walked the Galilean coast, Sometimes was sad forlorn; He left the earth to send the Holy Ghost, To guide us till that morn,

### Chorus

I want to hear angels sing, To bid me welcome to mansions bright and fair; I want to hear the glad harps ringing, with voices blending rich and rare; I want to see the Master bringing, A precious life crown that I may own and wear; I want to hear that mighty chorus sweetly sing, I want to hear that mighty chorus sweetly sing, I want to hear that mighty chorus sweetly sing, To hear it swell and ring.
