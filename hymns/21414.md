## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, what led the One, True Light Thru darkness up the hill? It was not the mob with cords and might, But 'twas the Father's will!

### Verse 2

O, what kept the Lamb of God So quiet and so still? It was not the shame of charges brought, But that it be fulfilled!

### Verse 3

O, what held the Prince of Peace In anguish on the cross? It was not the nails thru hands and feet, But love for all the lost!

### Verse 4

O, what caused the Shepherd great To lose His life that day? It was taken not by force or fate, But giv'n for sheep astray!
