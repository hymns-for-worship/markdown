## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is, beyond the azure blue, a God concealed from human sight, He tinted skies with heav'nly hue and framed the worlds with His great might.

### Verse 2

There was, a long long time ago, a God whose voice the prophets heard, He is the God that we should know, who speaks from His inspired Word.

### Verse 3

Secure, His life from mortal mind, God holds the germ within His hand, tho man may search they cannot find, for God alone does understand.

### Verse 4

Our God, whose Son upon a tree, a life was willing there to give, that He from sin might set man free, and evermore with Him could live.

### Chorus

There is a God, He is alive, in Him we live, and we survive; from dust our God created man, He is our God, the great I AM.
