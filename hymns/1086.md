## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Have you ever stood at the ocean with the white foam at your feet; Felt the endless thundering motion? Then I say you've seen Jesus my Lord.

### Verse 2

Have you ever stood at the sunset with the sky mellowing red; Seen the cloud suspended like feathers? Then I say you've seen Jesus my Lord.

### Chorus

Have you seen Jesus my Lord? He's here in plain view. Take a look, open your eyes, He'll show it to you.

### Verse 3

Have you ever stood at the cross with the man hanging in pain; Seen the look of love in His eyes? Then I say you've seen Jesus my Lord.

### Verse 4

Have you ever stood in the fam'ly with the Lord there in your midst; Seen the face of Christ in your brother? Then I say you've seen Jesus my Lord.
