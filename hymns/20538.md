## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Walking with Jesus along life's way, Know that He'll keep me each passing day; Nothing can harm me I'll hold His hand, Some glad tomorrow I'll reach Canaan Land.

### Verse 2

Tell how He made the poor blind to see, Tell how He stilled stormy Galilee; Tell how He prayed in Gethsemane, Tell of the path to Mount Calvary.

### Verse 3

Tell how He lives and He reigns above, Tell of the depths of His wond'rous love; Tell how He's coming again some day, Tell them to hasten His will obey.

### Verse 4

Great day is coming, I'll see my King, Praises forever I'll shout and sing; There thru the ages our voices ring, When in the sunshine, eternal spring.

### Chorus

Ring out the message o'er land and sea, Unfurl the banner salvation free; Tell them of Jesus of Galilee, Tell of His love there on Calvary.
