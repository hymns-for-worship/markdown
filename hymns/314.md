### Verse 1

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from immanuel's veins; and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains. Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains, and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

### Verse 2

Dear dying lamb, thy precious blood shall never lose its power, till all the ransomed church of God be saved to sin no more, be saved to sin no more, be saved to sin no more, till all the ransomed church of God be saved ot sin no more.

### Verse 3

E'er since by faith I saw the stream thy flowing wounds supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die, and shall be till I die, and shall be till I die, redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die.
