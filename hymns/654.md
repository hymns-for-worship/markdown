## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Are you weighed down with cares of life? Weak in temptation, faint in strife? Lean on the Lord to help you through, Almighty God will strengthen you.

### Verse 2

 Are you alone and far away? Find a calm place to sing and pray, For in the midst are gathered two; Allpresent God is there with you.

### Verse 3

 Are you afraid of coming years, Filled with uncertain joys and tears? Blessings or burdens, great or few, Allknowing God knows best for you.
