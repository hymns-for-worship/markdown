# 635 - A Beautiful Prayer

## Notation

C - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In the Bible we read of a beautiful pray'r, A pray'r sent to heaven above; It was prayed by a heart that was laden with care, And filled with such wonderful love.

### Verse 2

 You can catch the sad tone of His voice as He said, "Thy will not my own must be done;" As a lamb to the slaughter He soon must be led, To die as the Crucified One.

### Verse 3

 As He prayed there alone in such deep agony, It was a most beautiful pray'r; Just to think His great heart was all broken for me, That He my great sorrow must share.

### Chorus

When the Savior was praying, In the garden of Gethsemane, He said, "loving Father, if you will let this cup pass from me."  I know He was thinking of the anguish death would bring to His own, How deep was His sorrow, When Jesus was praying alone.
