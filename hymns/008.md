### Verse 1

Down at the cross where my Savior died, down where for cleansing from sin I cried, there to my heart was the blood applied; glory to His name.

### Verse 2

I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, there at the cross where He took me in; glory to His name.

### Verse 3

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, I am so glad I have entered in; there Jesus saves me and keeps me clean; glory to His name.

### Verse 4

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet; cast Thy poor soul at the Savior's feet; plunge in today and be made complete; glory to His name.

### Chorus

Glory to His name, glory to His name; there to my heart was the blood applied; glory to His name.
