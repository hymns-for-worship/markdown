## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O, Joseph, what will you choose to do? O, Joseph, it all depends on you. Will you stay with Potiphar's wife or will you run with all your might? O, Joseph, what will you choose to do?

### Verse 2

Well, Joseph, he chose to run away. Well, Joseph, he wants to live God's way. Potiphar's wife was really mad but Joseph said that's just too bad. Well, Joseph, he chose to run away.

### Verse 3

Like Joseph, I'll have to choose some day. Like Joseph, I want to live God's way. Even if it's hard to do I want to choose right. How 'bout you? Like Joseph, I'll have to choose some day.
