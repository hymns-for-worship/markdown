## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O Father, bless this solemn day, When we assemble, sing and pray, To honor Christ, Thine only Son, Who tasted death for ev'ryone. 

### Verse 2

 In fervent prayers and sacred hymns, We all cry out, "Remember Him," And cry within, "For me He died, And for my sins was crucified."

### Verse 3

 Then as we eat unleavened bread, And drink the cup, we bow our heads, And see the suff'ring death of Christ, His blood! His body! Sacrificed!

### Verse 4

 O Father, let us see His death, And hear "forgive them" on His breath, And feel His grief, disgrace and pain, O let us see His death again.
