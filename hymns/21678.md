### Verse 3

Tho' You are great enough to fully answer me, My doubt can limit Your rely to what I hope to see.




### Verse 4

But all I ask in faith I surely will receive; You long to show Your love in me; I only need believe.


### Verse 1

My Father, by Your will I ask Your care each day, Although You know the things I need and hear before I pray.

You wait until I seek the gifts You would impart, That You may see my faith revealed and gently try my heart, try my heart.
