## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a place of quiet refuge Where my spirit longs to go, When my troubles overwhelm me On the pathway here below. To my closet then I hasten; There unto the Lord I pray, In the place of quiet refuge From the tumult of the day.

### Verse 2

Not in temples high and lofty, Does the Lord seek to abide, But within a contrite spirit, Free from envy, self, and pride. There He'll build a sanctuary, Not of silver, nor of gold; Just a place of quiet refuge, Hidden deep within the soul.

### Verse 3

O, how oft I feel discouraged When adversity appears! How I struggle for an answer That will quiet all my fears. Then I suddenly remember Where to find the victory; In the place of quiet refuge, Where the Master meets with me.

### Verse 4

When this earthly life is over, and eternity shall dawn, There will be no disappointments Over in the great beyond. But forever and forever With my Savior I shall be, In a place of quiet refuge, All thruout eternity.
