## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Take my life, o Father; mould it in obedience to Thy will; and as rip'ning years unfold it, help me keep it childlike still.

### Verse 2

Father, keep it pure and holy, strong and brave, yet free from strife; turning from the paths unholy of a vain or sinful life.

### Verse 3

Ever let Thy might surround it; girding well the inner mind, will the cords of love have bound it Father, wholy unto Thine.
