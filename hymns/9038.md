## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Oh, Father, I do sin, and my heart breaks deep within. For You have sought me, yet I turn away from all Your loving care. So often do I fall, yet You reach out again, Lifting my burden that is more that I can ever bear.

### Verse 2

Through Your beloved Son, there is grace so undeserved, How can I ever sin against the One Who makes my heart to sing? Create a heat so clean that like You, I may be, As Light of Morning rises up with healing in its wings.

### Verse 3

My broken contrite heart is so worthless in my sight. But You restore it, give it peace and joy to love and follow You. Oh, may I ever strive to live pure in Your sight, Filled with Your goodness, free to glorify and honor You.
