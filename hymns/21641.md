## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He lives; proclaim the tidings; Bid back the clouds of gloom; Dismiss all doubts and chidings; The Lord has left the tomb.




### Verse 2

He lives; O tell the story To each and ev'ry one! The Lord of life and glory Has perfect vict'ry won.


### Verse 3

He lives; for  ever risen, Triumphantly He reigns; He opens now sin's prison, And breaks the captive's chain.




### Chorus

Send forth the proclamation; Light breaks upon the grave; Accept the full salvation; He lives, He lives to save.
