## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Father, whtching over me, and leading me thru life, so many times I  call to Thee in sorrow, guilt and strife. And faithful, Lord, art Thou nearby to answer every prayer. Protect me Lord, lest I deny our fellowhip, Thy care.

### Verse 2

O Father, Thou spared not Thy Son, but bought us with His blood; from many nations, made Thou one United brotherhood. Where e'er we gather in His name, a common love we share, at home, in distant land, the same communion everywhere!

### Verse 3

Past children of Thy covenant, from every age and land, ascended upward, truimphant, and joined a mighty band. One day, we hope to sing with them the hymn composed beyond, and with Thy congregation, from an everlasting bond.
