## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O lord I come to thee, thy blood is all my plea, myself I give for thee to live, devoted thus to be; o let thy love be mine, and fill with joy divine, thy tender care now let me share, my life, my all, are thine.

### Verse 2

O lord of truth and love, all earthly things above, thy life bestow and make me know thy righteous will to prove; o keep me in the light, and lead me by thy might, till life shall end and I ascend, to heav'n where all is bright.

### Verse 3

Thy word I would obey, and keep from day to day, thy precepts pure and thus secure my heart from errors way. Then let the world deride, within thy love I'll hide, no foes can harm nor fears alarm, while keeping near thy side.
