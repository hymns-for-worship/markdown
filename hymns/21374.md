## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Take Thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray; Give us the mind of Christ each passing day; Teach us to know the truth that sets us free; Grant us in all our tho'ts to honor Thee.

### Verse 2

Take Thou our hearts, O Christ, they are Thine own; Come Thou within our souls and claim Thy throne; Help us to shed abroad Thy deathless love; Use us to make the earth like heav'n above.

### Verse 3

Take Thou our wills, most High! Hold Thou full sway; Have in our inmost souls Thy perfect way; Guard Thou each sacred hour from selfish ease; Guide Thou our ordered lives as Thou dost please.

### Verse 4

Take Thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind and will; Thru our surrendered souls Thy plans fulfill. We yield ourselves to Thee, time, talents, all! We hear, and henceforth heed Thy sov'reign call.
