## Notation

A - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Buried with Christ and raised with Him too, What is there left for me to do? Simply to cease from struggling and strife, Simply to walk in newness of life.

### Verse 2

Risen with Christ, my glorious Head, Holiness now the pathway tread; Beautiful tho't while walking therein, He that is dead is freed from all sin.

### Verse 3

Living with Christ, Who dieth no more, Following Christ, who goeth before; I am from bondage utterly freed, Reckoning self as dead indeed.

### Verse 4

Living with Christ, my members I yield, Servant of God forevermore sealed; Not under law, I'm now under grace, Sin is dethroned and Christ takes its place.

### Chorus

Buried with Christ and dead unto sin; Dying but living, Jesus within; ruling and reigning day after day, Guiding and keeping all of the way.
