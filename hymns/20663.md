# 20663 - WHAT IS A MIRACLE

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What is a miracle? Do you know? Amazing as can be. God can make someone walk, control the storm, or make a blind man see.

### Verse 2

What is a miracle? Do you know? It's not a magic trick. It's not like pulling rabbits from a hat, or flowers from a stick.

### Verse 3

What is a miracle? Do you know? It helps me to believe, that my Father in heaven controls it all and that He does love me.
