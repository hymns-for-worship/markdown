### Verse 1

Not my will, Not my will. Never my own. All Thine alone. He kneeled, fell to the ground, O Abba, take away this cup. Thy Will Be Done.

### Verse 2

Not my will, Not my will. Never my own. All Thine alone. Intense the agony, while sweat as blood fell to the ground. Thy Will Be Done.

Not my will, Not my will. Never my own. All Thine alone. He offered prayers and tears; as man, He learned  obedience. Not my will, Thy Will Be Done.
