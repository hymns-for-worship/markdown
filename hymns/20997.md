Blessed are the poor in spirit the kingdom now they do receive; Blessed are those who at their sins mourn, God shall comfort them with His true grace.

Blessed are the Lord's meek servants, God's inheritance they shall receive; Blessed are those who thirst and hunger, God shall fill them with His great love.
