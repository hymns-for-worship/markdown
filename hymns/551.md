## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Walk in the light! and you shall know That fellowship of love, His Spirit only can bestow Who reigns in light above. 

### Verse 2

 Walk in the light! and you  shall find Your heart made truly His, Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined, In whom no darkness be. 

### Verse 3

 Walk in the light! and you shall see Your darkness pass away, Because the light has come to be, In which is perfect day.

### Verse 4

 Walk in the light! and you shall share Your path, though thorny, bright; For God in grace walks with you there, And God Himself is light.
