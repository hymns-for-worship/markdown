## Lyrics

### Verse 1

While on earth if I have been faithful, And have lived by His Holy Word; I will sing with the chorus in Heaven; Sweeter music than I've ever heard.

### Verse 2

I will strive to follow my Savior, And obey His ev'ry command. Then some day I will reach that forever, He's prepared on that faraway strand.

### Verse 3

There the saved will praise Him forever, All their voices sweetly will blend; When we sing with the chorus in Heaven; In that beautiful home without end.

### Chorus

Singing praise with the chorus in Heaven, The saints singing praise to the King. Singing praise with the chorus in Heaven. O! what wonderful songs we will sing.
