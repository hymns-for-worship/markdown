## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The Lord's my Shepherd; I'll not want: He makes me down to lie In pastures green; He leadeth me In pastures green, He leadeth me The quiet wa ters by. 

### Verse 2

 My soul  He doth restore again, And me to walk doth make Within the paths  of righteousness, Within the paths of righteousness, E'en for His own name's sake. 

### Verse 3

 Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will I fear none ill; For Thou art with me, and Thy rod, For Thou art with me and Thy rod And staff me comfort still.

### Verse 4

  My table Thou hast furnished In presence of my foes; My head Thou dost with oil anoint, My head Thou dost with oil anoint, And my cup overflows. 

### Verse 5

Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely fol low me; And in God's house forevermore, And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be.
