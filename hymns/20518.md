## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Rock in the desert, I fly unto Thee, When tempest and storms sweep the sky, I hide in the cleft that was riven for me, For safety on Thee I rely.

### Verse 2

O Rock in the desert, my refuge and all, I hide in my weakness in Thee; thy love is a shield and I find sweet repose, Where grace is abundant and free.

### Verse 3

O Rock in the desert that gives perfect peace, That bringeth a joy to my soul; I rest in Thy shadow, I hide in thy cleft, Thy love doth my spirit control.

### Chorus

O Rock in the desert, I'm hiding in Thee, Till the storms of life's journey are past; Thou Rock of my refuge, my soul safely keep, O receive it in heaven at last.
