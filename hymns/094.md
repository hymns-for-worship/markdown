### Verse 1

Savior, breathe and evening blessing ere repose our spirits seal; sin and want we come confessing: Thou canst save and Thou canst heal.

### Verse 2

Tho' destruction walk around us, tho' the arrows past us fly, angel guards from Thee surround us: we are safe if Thou art nigh.

### Verse 3

Tho' the night be dark and dreary, darkness cannot hide from Thee; Thou art He who, never weary, watchest where Thy people be.

### Verse 4

Should swift death this night o'ertake us, and our couch become our tomb, may the morn in heav'n awake us, clad in bright and deathless bloom. 

### Amen

Amen.
