Jesus is tenderly calling thee home, calling to day, calling today; why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam farther and farther away?

Jesus is waiting, o come to hime now, waiting today, waiting today; come with thy sins at his feet lowly bow, come and no longer delay.

### Verse 4

Jesus is pleading o list to his voice, pleading today, pleading today, they who believe on his name shall rejoice, quickly arise and obey.

Calling today! Calling today! Jesus is calling, he's tenderly calling today.
