Do you know the strongest man? Samson! Strongest man in all the land. Samson! Your friend's not nice, O, please beware, When you're asleep, She'll cut your hair. O, Samson what are you gonna do?

Tied up tight, his eyes plucked out, Samson! "Bring him here!" the people shout, Samson! He prayed to God, "Please give me strength," He killed them all. Now what d'ya think? Yes, Samson's a mighty man of God.
