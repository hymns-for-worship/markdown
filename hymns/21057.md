# 21057 - WILL THE ANGELS COME FOR ME

## Notation

Db - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When my work on earth is ended, Will the angels come for me? Will they bear me on their pinions O'er the dark and stormy sea?

### Verse 2

When life's sun is slowly sinking, And the soul will soon be free, Will the gates of heaven open, And the angels come for me?

### Verse 3

Will the angels bear me upward To that home so bright and fair? There to be with Christ my Savior, And the ransomed gathered there?

### Chorus

Will the angels come for me, When I cross the stormy sea? Will they take me home to God, When the long, rough way I've trod?
