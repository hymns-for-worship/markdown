## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My life is new Christ is Master. I have yielded to Him, I'm free. The yoke of sin has been broken, By His suff'ring on Calvary.

### Verse 2

I'm born of water and Spirit. I'm a child in God's family. E'en now I share in Christ's glory, And a mansion in heav'n for me.

### Verse 3

I'm happy living in Jesus. I rejoice in His love so free. How wondrous are His great blessings; What a fellowship dear to me.

### Chorus

Rejoice! Praise God! Alleluia! Come share my joy with me. Believe, obey, and serve Jesus, Then heaven eternally.
