## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I see the diamonds of God's mind, He draped the sky for me to find. Celesial light sreams from each gem: It tells He created them.

### Verse 2

Int he dark stillness of the night, they glorify the King with light. Holy and pure, their voices blend, Since time began, till time shall end.

### Verse 3

God's holy throne, do they surround, And join the planets gathered 'round! Hear the moon sing its glor'ous hymns, The sky is filled with praise for Him.

### Verse 4

I want to join, my heart o'erflows. It cannot hold the awe I know. And so, my re'rent voice is raised: I sing to Him creation's praise.
