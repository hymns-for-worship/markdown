## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne; Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone; Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion Thunder like a mighty flood; Jesus, out of ev'ry nation Has redeemed us by His blood.

### Verse 2

Alleluia! not as orphans Are we left in sorrow now; Alleluia! He is near us, Faith believes, nor questions how; Tho' the clouds from sight received Him When the forty days were o'er, Shall our hearts forget His promise, "I am with you evermore"?

### Verse 3

Alleluia! Bread of Heaven, You on earth our food, and stay! Alleluia! here the sinful Flee to You from day to day; Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth's redeemer, plead for me, Where the songs of all the sinless Sweep across the crystal sea. Amen.
