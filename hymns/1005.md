# 1005 - Farther Along

## Notation

F - 9/8 on 7 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder Why it should be thus all the day long, While there are others living about us, Never molested tho' in the wrong.

### Verse 2

When death has come and taken our loved ones, It leaves our home so lonely and drear; Then do we wonder why others prosper, Living so wicked year after year.

### Verse 3

Faithful 'til death said our loving Master, A few more days to labor and wait; Toils of the road will then seem as nothing, As we sweep thro' the beautiful gate.

### Chorus

Farther along we'll know all about it, Farther along we'll understand why; Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine, We'll understand it all by and by.

### Verse 4

When we see Jesus coming in glory, When He comes from His home in the sky; Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion, We'll understand it all by and by.
