## Lyrics

### Verse 1

As I behold the sunrise o'er the ocean, I know that God, my Lord, is ever near. I watch the waves that ebb and flow before me, And know my life rests in His loving care.

### Verse 2

As I behold the sunshine on the meadow, I know that God provides for all my needs. I smell the rain and feel the gentle breezes, And know His love protects and comforts me.

### Verse 3

As I behold the sky with clouds forth coming, I know that storms may fill my life with tears. I hear the promise made to all the faithful, And know that soon a rainbow will appear.

### Chorus

This is the day the Lord has now created. Let us rejoice and fill the day with cheer. His Word still lives, and yes, He watches o'er me, For day by day, His hand is every near.

### Verse 4

As I behold the sunset o'er the mountains, I know that God controls the close of day. I stand in awe of all that He's created, And dream of Heav'n; a world beyond compare.
