## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Won't you remember your Creator in the days of your youth? Won't you remember your Creator in the days of your youth? If you remember Him before you're grown, He'll bless you more than you can know. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth.

### Verse 2

Samuel remembered his Creator in the days of his youth. Samuel remembered his Creator in the days of his youth. He listened close to what God said that night, and obeyed God with all his might, and God made him the last judge over Israel.

### Verse 3

Won't you remember your Creator in the days of your youth? Won't you remember your Creator in the days of your youth? If you start now to serve your God above, He'll use you in His work of love. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth.
