## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Almost persuaded now to believe, almost persuaded, christ ot receive; seems now some soul to say go spirit go thy way, some more convenient day, on thee I'll call.

### Verse 2

Almost persuaded, come, come today, almost persuaded, turn not away; Jesus invites you here, angels are lingering near, prayers rise from hearts so dear, o wandr'er come.

### Verse 3

Almost persuaded, harvest is past! Almost persuaded, doom comes at last! Almost cannot avail; almost is but to fail; sad, sad, that bitter wail, almost but lost!
