## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Shall we gather at the river, Where bright angel feet have trod, With its crystal tide forever Flowing by the throne of God?

### Verse 2

On the margin of the river, Washing up its silver spray, We will walk and worship ever, All the happy golden day.

### Verse 3

Ere we reach the shining river, Lay we ev'ry burden down; Grace our spirits will deliver, And provide a robe and crown.

### Chorus

Yes, we'll gather at the river, The beautiful, the beautiful river, Gather with the saints at the river, That flows by the throne of God.

### Verse 4

Soon weâ€™ll reach the shining river, soon our pilgrimage will cease, soon our happy hearts will quiver, with the melody of peace.

### Verse 5

At the smiling of the river, Mirror of the Savior's face, Saints whom death will never sever Lift their songs of saving grace.
