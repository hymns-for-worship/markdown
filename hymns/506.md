# 506 - The Kingdoms Of Earth Pass Away

## Notation

A - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 The kingdoms of earth pass away one by one, But the kingdom of heaven remains; It is built on a rock and the Lord is its King, And forever and ever He reigns. 

### Verse 2

 The tempest may rage and its anger acclaim, Yea, the wind and the torrents may roar, And the strong gates of hell may assail it in vain, Still the kingdom shall stand ever more. 

### Verse 3

 The kingdom of God is now open to all, E'en the vilest may now enter in; There's a welcome for all who will turn to the Lord, Full salvation and pardon for sin. 

### Chorus

It shall stand, It shall stand, Forever and ever and ever, It shall stand, It shall stand, Forever and ever. Amen and Amen.
