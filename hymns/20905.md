## Lyrics

### Verse 1

From Calvary a cry was heard A bitter and heartrending cry: Our Savior's ev'ry mournful word Spoke of His soul's deep agony.

### Verse 2

A horror of great darkness fell On Christ, the spotless holy One! And all the swarming hosts of hell Conspired to tempt God's only Son.

### Verse 3

The scourge, the thorns, the deep disgrace These Thou couldst bear, nor once repine; But when Jehovah veiled His face, sharp, overwhelming pangs were Thine.

### Verse 4

Lord! on Your cross I fix my eyes; If e'er I lose its strong control, O! let that dying, piercing cry, Melt and reclaim my wand'ring soul.

### Verse 5

Lord! on Thy cross I fix mine eye; If e'er I lose its strong control, O! let that dying, piercing cry, Melt and reclaim my wand'ring soul.
