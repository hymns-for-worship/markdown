# 21321 - ENOUGH FOR MY GOD

## Notation

D - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In God is the light, the brightest day. He taught me to walk the narrow way, Yet still I chose the path that was broad: O, how could I be enough for my God?

### Verse 2

With mercy so sweet, He led me along. He held my hand, and gave me a song, Yet still I sinned, a shameful fraud: O, how could I be enough for my God?

### Verse 3

I never had dreamed the day I'd see the Son of God, who died for me, Yet here by His side, I stand in awe: Washed by His blood, enough for my God.

### Chorus

And who could forgive all the sins and the flaws? O, how could I be enough for my God? But gently He'll lead by staff and by rod, And help me to be enough for my God.

### Coda

I just want to be Enough for You, God!
