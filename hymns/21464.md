## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Amid this swiftly changing world When a calm cannot be found, God gives us hope and faith and love, Gracious blessings that abound.

### Verse 2

When changes and transitions come To distract us from all peace, Let's set our minds on things above, For God's mercies never cease.

### Verse 3

God's promises are wonderful And His Word's our sword and shield; Christ's constant love's our living hope, And the Spirit is our seal.

### Chorus

He is our anchor in the storm, The foundation of our days, The solid rock on which we stand, And our cornerstone of faith.
