## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The Lord is my light, my salvation. Of whom shall I ever have fear? The Lord is the strength of my living. It's He I will always hold dear.

### Verse 2

The wicked cannot come against me. They rise up, then stumble and fall. Tho' battle should rise up against me, I'm confident, faithful in all.

### Verse 3

One thing I desire of my Lord is To live in His house all my life. I'll see all the beauty around me. He'll set me far over the strife.

### Verse 4

Teach me all Your glorious way, Lord. Lead me in a path that is plain. I will not lose heart in believing. The goodness of God I will gain. 

### Chorus

Wait on the Lord! Wait on the Lord! Be of good courage! He'll strengthen your heart! Just wait on the Lord!
