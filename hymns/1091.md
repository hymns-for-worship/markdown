### Verse 1

Stay with  us, O risen Jesus; Go no farther than this place; We are gathered at Your table, bless our feasting with Your grace.

### Verse 2

Tho' we walk with You unseeing, Thru the labors of the week; On this day of resurrection, Be revealed to us, and speak.

### Verse 3

By this bread and cup, instruct us in the life You sacrificed; Tell the suff'rings and the glories That together name You Christ.

### Verse 4

Teach our hearts to burn within us As we hear all You have said; Thus, Lord, may we recognize You In the breaking of the bread.
