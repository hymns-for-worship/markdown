How sweet will be the welcome home when this short life is o'er; when pain and sorrow, grief and care, shall trouble us no more.

When we the lovely promised land with spirit eyes shall see; we'll join the holy angel band in praise, dear Lord, to thee.

If we are faithful we shall gain the land of promised rest; where with the savior we shall live and be forever blest.

Welcome home, sweet welcome home, my home, sweet home, welcome home, sweet welcome home, the christian's welcome home.
