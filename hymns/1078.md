## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Faithful love flowing down from the thorn-covered crown, Makes me whole, saves my soul, washes whiter than snow; Faithful love calms each fear, reaches down, dries each tear, Holds my hand when I can't stand on my own. Faithful love from above came to earth to show the Father's love; And I'll never be the same, for I've seen faithful love face to face, and Jesus is His name.

### Verse 2

Faithful love is a friend just when hope seems to end, Welcome face, sweet embrace, tender touch filled with grace; Faithful love, endless pow'r, living flame, Spirit's fire, Burning bright in the night, guiding my way. Faithful love from above came to earth to show the Father's love; And I'll never be the same, for I've seen faithful love face to face, and Jesus is His name.
