# 20262 - THE GIFT OF LOVE

## Notation

A - 4/4 on 2 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tho' I may speak with bravest fire, and have the gift to all inspire; And have not love, my words are vain, as sounding brass and hopeless gain.

### Verse 2

Tho' I may give all I possess, and striving so my love profess; But not be giv'n by love within, the profit soon turns strangly thin.

### Verse 3

Come, Spirit, come our hearts control, our spirits long to be made whole; Let inward love guide ev'ry deed: By this we worship and are freed.
