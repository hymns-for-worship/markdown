## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord; She is His new creation By water and the word. From heav'n He came and sought her To be His holy bride; With His own blood He bought her And for her life He died.

### Verse 2

Elect from ev'ry nation, Yet one o'er all the earth; Her charter of salvation, One Lord, one faith, one birth. One holy name she blesses, Partakes one holy food And to one hope she presses, With ev'ry grace endued.

### Verse 3

Mid toil and tribulation, And tumult of her war, she waits the consummation Of peace forevermore. Till, with the vision glorious, Her longing eyes are blest, And the great church victorious Shall be the church at rest.
