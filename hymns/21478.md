## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Stand up and bless the LORD, Ye people of His choice; Stand up and bless the LORD your God With heart and soul and voice.


### Verse 2

Tho' high above all praise, Above all blessing high, Who would not fear His holy name, And laud and magnify?


### Verse 3

O for the living flame From His own altar brought, To touch our lips, our minds inspire, And wing to heav'n our thought!

### Verse 4

God is our strength and song, And His salvation ours; Then be His love in Christ proclaimed With all our ransomed pow'rs.

### Verse 5

Stand up and bless the LORD; The LORD your God adore; Stand up and bless His glorious name Henceforth forevermore.
