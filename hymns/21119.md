## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There waits for me a glad tomorrow, Where gates of pearl swing open wide; And when I've passed this vale of sorrow, I'll dwell upon the other side. 

### Verse 2

Someday I'll hear the angels singing, Beyond the shadows of the tomb, And all the bells of heaven ringing, While saints are singing, "Home, sweet home."

### Verse 3

Someday my labors will be ended, And all my wand'rings will be o'er; And all earth's broken ties be mended, And I shall sigh and weep no more.

### Verse 4

Someday the dark clouds will be rifted, And all the night of gloom be past; And all life's burdens will be lifted The day of rest shall dawn at last.

### Chorus

Someday beyond the reach of mortal ken; Someday God only knows just where and when The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still, And I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill.
