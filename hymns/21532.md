## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Rejoice, ye pure in heart, Rejoice, give thanks and sing; Your festal banner wave on high, The cross of Christ your King.


### Verse 2

With all the angel choirs, With all the saints on earth, Pour out the strains of joy and bliss, True rapture, nobl'est mirth!


### Verse 3

Yes, on thru life's long path, Still chanting as ye go; From youth to age, by night and day, In gladness and in woe.


### Verse 4

Still lift your standard high, Still march in firm array; As warriors thru the darkness toil Till dawns the golden day.


### Chorus

Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks and sing!
