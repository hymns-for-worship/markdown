### Verse 1

Jesus calls us o'er the tumult of our life's wild restless sea, day by day His sweet voice soundeth, saying, "christian follow me."

### Verse 2

Jesus call us from the worship of the vain world's golden store; from each idol that would keep us, saying, "chistian love me more."

### Verse 3

In our joys and in our sorrow, days of toils and hours of ease, still he calls in cares and pleasures, "christian, love me more than these."

### Verse 4

Jesus calls us by thy mercies, savior, make us hear thy call, give our hearts to thine obedience, serve and love thee best of all.
