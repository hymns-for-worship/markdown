### Verse 1

Christ is risen, He is risen, Conquering death He rose from the grave; Now victorious, reigning o'er us, We rejoice! Our sins He forgave.

### Verse 2

Christ is living, He is living, Interceding priest on high; Ever loving and forgiving, He's our friend, to Him we cry.

### Verse 3

Christ is coming, Yes, He's coming, He's returning for His own; Come! adore Him, bow before Him, Join with angels 'round God's throne.

### Chorus

Glory, honor, adoration, Lord, to You glad voices we raise; As we offer our devotion Fill our hearts with heaven's endless praise.
