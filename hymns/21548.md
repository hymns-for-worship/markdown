# 21548 - MY LORD, YOU WORE NO ROYAL CROWN

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

My Lord, You wore no royal crown; You did not wield the pow'rs of state, Nor did You need a scholar's gown Or priestly robe to make You great.



### Verse 2

You never used a killer's sword To end an unjust tyranny; Your only weapon was Your word, For truth alone could set us free.


### Verse 3

You did not live a world away In hermit's cell or desert cave, But felt our pain and shared each day With those You came to seek and save.
