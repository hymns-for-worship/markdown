## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sweetly, Lord, have we heard thee calling, come follow me, and we see where thy footsteps falling lead us to thee.

### Verse 2

If they lead through the temple holy, preaching the word; or in homes of the poor and lowly, serving the Lord.

### Verse 3

Then at last, when on high he sees us, our journey done, we will rest where the steps of Jesus end at His throne.

Footprints of Jesus that make the pathway glow, we will follow the steps of Jesus wheree'er they go.
