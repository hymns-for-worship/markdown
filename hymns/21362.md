## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Children of the heav'nly Father Safely in His bosom gather; Nestling bird nor star in heaven Such a refuge e'er was given.

### Verse 2

Neither life nor death shall ever From the Lord His children sever; Unto them His grace He showeth, And their sorrows all He knoweth.

### Verse 3

Though He giveth or He taketh, God His children ne'er forsaketh, His the loving purpose solely To preserve them pure and holy.

### Verse 4

God His own doth tend and nourish; In His holy courts they flourish, From all evil things He spares them; In His mighty arms He bears them.
