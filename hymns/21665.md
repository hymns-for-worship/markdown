## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands For our offenses given; But now at God's right hand Christ stands And brings us life from heaven; Therefore let us joyful be And sing to God right thankfully Loud songs of Alleluia! Alleluia!



### Verse 2

It was a strange and dreadful strife When life and death contended; The victory remained with life; The reign of death was ended. Holy Scripture plainly saith That death is swallowed up by death; Its sting is lost forever! Alleluia!



### Verse 3

Then let us feast, this new Lord's day. On the true bread of heaven; The Word of grace hath purged away The old and wicked leaven. Christ alone our souls will feed; Christ is our meat and drink indeed; Faith lives upon no other! Alleluia!
