# 254 - On Jordan's Stormy Banks

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye, to Canaan's fair and happy land, where my possessions lie.

### Verse 2

O'er all those wide extended plains, shines one eternal day; there God, the son, forever reigns and scatters night away.

### Verse 3

Filled with delight, my raptured soul would here no longer stay; Tho Jordan's waves around me roll, fearless, I'll launch away.

### Chorus

We will rest in that fair and happy land by and by just across from the evergreen shore, sing the song of Moses and the lamb, by and by, and dwell with Jesus evermore.
