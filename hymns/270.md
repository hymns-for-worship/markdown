### Verse 1

Give me thy heart, says the Father above, no gift so precious to him as our love; softly he shisper wherever thou art, "gratefully trust me and give me thy heart,"

### Verse 2

Give me thy heart says the savior of men, calling in mercy again and again; turn now from sin and from evil depart; have I not died for thee? Give me thy heart.

### Verse 3

Give me thy heart says the spirit divine, all that thou hast to my keeping resign; grace more abounding is mine to impart, make full surrender, and give me thy heart.

### Chorus

Give me thy heart, give me thy heart, hear the soft whisper wherever thou art; from this dark world he would draw thee apart, speaking so tenderly, give me thy heart.
