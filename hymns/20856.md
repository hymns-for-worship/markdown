Just You and me, Lord, Under the blue sky; Just You and me, Lord, watching the birds fly. Just You and me, Lord, I'm happy to say, If it's You and me Lord, It will be a fine day.

### Verse 2

Just You and me, Lord, Down on my knees; Just You and me, Lord, begging You please. Just You and me, Lord, When I need to pray, If it's You and me Lord, It will be a fine day.

Just You and me, Lord, Going along; Just You and me, Lord, singing a praise song. Just You and me, Lord, As You lead the way. If it's You and me, Lord,  It will be a fine day.
