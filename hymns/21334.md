## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How great the promises of God, By which He calls us from our sin; How sweet the word that we so flawed May be His children once again. How precious and magnificent, The hope we have of what  He'll do; If you, O sinner will repent, Then know the promise is for you. 

### Verse 2

The promise came so long ago, Confirmed with signs for those who heard; At gate and temple portico, A multitude received the word. That same implanted word, we preach; Forever living, always new; Its promise is the same for each, And now the promise is for you.

### Verse 3

No burden is too terrible; No guilty sinner is too vile; Our Our Fa-ther loves the prodigal, And He will spread His arms and smile. As arms and smile. As we have chosen, make your choice, And share in His forgiveness too; While all the hosts of heav'n rejoice, O come! The promise is for you.
