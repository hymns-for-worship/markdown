## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thru all life's trials and troubles, We struggle to win over wrong. While temptations lure around, When we're weak, with Christ we are strong. 

### Verse 2

When we lose our dearest loved ones, Our hearts are too sad for a song; And all earthly hopes are shattered, When w'ere weak, with Christ we are strong.

### Verse 3

When our fleshly strength starts failing, for relief from pain we do long; And our feeble frame is burdened, When we're weak, with Christ we are strong.

### Verse 4

When at last we cross death's river, And bid farewell to earthly throng; The angels will bear our spirits, Then with Christ we will be ever strong.

### Chorus

Oh what strenght Lord with You; What a hope and consolation.
