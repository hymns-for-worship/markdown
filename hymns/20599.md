### Verse 1

Fight the good fight with all thy might, Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right Lay hold on life, and it shall be Thy joy and crown eternally.

### Verse 2

Run the straight race thru God's good grace, Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face; Life with its way before us lies, Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

### Verse 3

Cast care aside, upon thy Guide Lean, and His mercy will provide; Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

Faint not nor fear, His arms are near, He changeth not, and thou art dear; Only believe, and thou shalt see That Christ is all in all to thee.
