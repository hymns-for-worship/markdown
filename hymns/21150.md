### Verse 1

O God of Bethel, by whose hand Thy people still are fed, Who thru this weary pilgrimage Hast all our fathers led.

### Verse 2

Our vows, our pray'rs, we now present Before Thy throne of grace; God of our fathers, be the God Of their succeeding race.

Thru each perplexing path of life Our wand'ring footsteps guide; Give us each day our daily bread, And raiment fit provide.
