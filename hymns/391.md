## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Savior, like a shepherd lead us, Much we need Thy tender care; In Thy pleasant pastures feed us, For our use Thy folds prepare: Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Thou hast bought us, Thine we are; Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Thou hast bought us, Thine we are. 

### Verse 2

 We are Thine, do Thou befriend us, Be the Guardian of our way; Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us, Seek us when we go astray: Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Hear Thy children when they pray; Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Hear Thy children when they pray. 

### Verse 3

 Thou hast promised to receive us, Poor and sinful tho' we be; Thou hast mercy to relieve us, Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free: Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Early let us turn to Thee; Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Early let us turn to Thee. 

### Verse 4

 Early let us seek Thy favor; Early let us do Thy will; Blessed Lord and only Savior, With Thy love our bosoms fill: Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Thou hast loved us, love us still; Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Thou hast loved us, love us still.
