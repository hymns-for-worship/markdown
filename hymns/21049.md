## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Ah, holy Jesus, how have You offended, that mortal judgment has on You descended? By foes derided, by Your own rejected, O most afflicted!

### Verse 2

Who was the guilty? Who bro't this upon You? Alas, my treason, Jesus, has undone You! 'Twas I, Lord Jesus, I it was denied You; I crucified You.

### Verse 3

Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered; The slave has sinnéd, and the Son has suffered. For our atonement, while we nothing heeded, God interceded.

### Verse 4

For me, kind Jesus, was Your incarnation, Your mortal sorrow, and Your life's oblation; Your death of anguish and Your bitter passion, for my salvation.

### Verse 5

Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay You, I do adore You, and will ever pray You, think on Your pity and Your love unswerving, not my deserving.
