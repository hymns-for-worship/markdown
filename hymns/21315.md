## Lyrics

### Verse 2

For the souls that overcome Waits the beauteous heav'nly home, Where the blessed evermore Tread, on high, the starry floor.

### Verse 3

’Tis no palm of fading leaves That the conqu'ror’s hand receives; Joys are his, serene and pure, Light that ever shall endure.

### Verse 4

Passing soon and little worth are the things that tempt on earth; heav'nward lift thy soul's regard: God Himself is thy reward.

### Verse 1

Soldiers who are Christ's below, Strong in faith resist the foe: Boundless is the pledged reward Unto them who serve the Lord.

### Verse 5

Father, who the crown dost give, Savior, by whose death we live, Spirit, who our hearts dost raise, Three in One, Thy name we praise.
