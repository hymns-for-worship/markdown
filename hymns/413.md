## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I believe in the One they called Jesus, I believe He stilled storm Gallilee; I believe that He walked on the water, And I believe that He's the answer for me.


### Verse 2

I believe in the words of the Bible, How He made the poor blind man to see; I believe that the deaf ears were opened, And I believe He's made a diff'rence in me.


### Verse 3

 I believe that He spoke to dead Laz'rus, And He said, "Unbind and set free;" I believe that He reigns up in heaven, And I believe that He is coming again. 


### Chorus

Yes,I believe in the One they called Jesus, I believe He died on Mount Calvary; And I believe that the tomb was found empty, And I believe that He's the answer for me.
