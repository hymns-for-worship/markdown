## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It may not be on the mountain height Or over the stormy sea It may not be at the battle's front My Lord will have need of me. But if, by a still, small voice He calls To paths that I do not know, I'll answer, dear Lord, with my  hand in thine: I'll go where You want me to go.

### Verse 2

Perhaps today there are loving words Which Jesus would have me speak; There may be now in the paths of sin Some wand'rer whom I should seek. O Savior, if Thou wilt be my guide, Tho' dark and rugged the way, My voice shall echo the message sweet: I'll say what You want me to say.

### Verse 3

There's surely somewhere a lowly place In earth's harvest fields so wide Where I may labor thru life's short day For Jesus, the Crucified. So trusting my all to thy tender care, And knowing Thou lovest me, I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere: I'll be what You want me to be.

### Chorus

I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, Over mountain or plain or sea: I'll say what
