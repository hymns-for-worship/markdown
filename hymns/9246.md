Be strong and courageous, you hosts of the Lord! Rise up for the battle, and gird on your swords! The land of His promise is yours now by right; Take all He has given; go forth to the fight!

Be strong and courageous, through God you will win, though great be the armies of error and sin. Your Captain will lead you to conquer the land; His arm cannot fail you, and they cannot stand.
