## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O come to me, the Master said, My Father knows your need; And I shall be, the Master said, Your bread of life indeed.
By faith in Him we live and grow And share the broken bread, And all His love and goodness know, For so the Master said.

### Verse 2

Abide in me, the Master said, The true and living vine; My life shall be, the Master said, Poured out for you as wine. His body to the cross He gave, His blood He freely shed, Who came in love to seek and save, For so the Master said.

### Verse 3

Believe in Me, the Master said, For I have called you friends, And yours shall be, the Master said, The life that never ends. And so, with sin and sorrow past, When death itself is dead, The Lord shall raise us up at last, For so the Master said.
