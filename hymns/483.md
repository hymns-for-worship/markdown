## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Jesus my Lord will love me forever, From Him no pow'r of evil can sever; He gave His life to ransom my soul, 

### Verse 2

 Once I was lost in sin's degradation, Jesus came down to bring me salvation, Lifted me up from sorrow and shame, Now I belong to Him.

### Verse 3

 Joy floods my soul, for Jesus has saved me, Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me; His precious blood He gave to redeem, 

### Chorus

Now I belong to Jesus, Jesus belongs to me, Not for the years of time alone, But for eternity.
