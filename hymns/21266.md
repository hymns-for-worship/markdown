Who is there, O my God, that I desire but You? Who is there on the earth that draws me near like You? My Lord! O My Lord! O my God! I need You ev'ry day. Who is there, O my Lord, that walks with me but You? Who is there up above that strengthens me like You? O My Lord! O my God! I'll live with You each day.
