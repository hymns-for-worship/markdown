## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the harvest is past and the summer is o'er, When glean'd is the grain that in rare beauty waved, How fearful my fate if my soul not be saved, When the harvest is past and the summer is o'er! 

### Verse 2

Pray'rless sinner so dear, for whom Jesus has died, He calls to the labor obey, 'tis thy Lord, Hear His voice, reap the grain and receive thy reward, Pray'rless sinner so dear, for whom Jesus has died. 

### Verse 3

When the Lord shall descend, and the reappers go home, The sheaves may be many, the harvest be long; But only the faithful will join in the song, When the Lord shall descend, and the reappers go home.

### Chorus

In vain, in vain the broad field, In vain, in vain the rich yield, And the ripening grain of the harvest which waved, Over hillside and plain, if our souls be not saved.
