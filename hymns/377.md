## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When we behold the wonders of creation, The flow'rs that bloom, the raindrops as they fall; The spacious skies and life's perpetuation, We cannot doubt that God controlled it all. 

### Verse 2

 No finite mind, by mortal calculation Could frame the truths revealed within His Word; In ev'ry trace of nature's operation, Thy voice, O God, in myst'ry can be heard.

### Verse 3

 When we perceive the state of alienation In which the soul, from Thee, O God, was lost; We must believe, by heaven's ordination, Our Lord redeemed and paid the bitter cost. 

### Verse 4

 Some days are filled with joy and expectation, Some days are dark, with cares we are beset; In hours of joy or hours of tribulation, Be with us Lord, lest we, lest we forget. 

### Chorus

Lord, I believe, yes, I believe, I cannot doubt or be deceived; The eye that sees each sparrow fall, His unseen hand is in it all.
