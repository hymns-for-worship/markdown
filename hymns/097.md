# 097 - O To Be Like Thee

## Notation

D - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 3

O to be like Thee! Lowly in spirit, holy and harmless, patient and brave; meekly enduring cruel reproaches, willing to suffer, others to save.

### Verse 1

O to be like Thee! Blessed Redeemer: this is my constant longing and prayer; gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures, Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

### Verse 2

O to be like Thee! Full of compassion, loving, forgiving, tender and kind, helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, seeking the wand'ring sinner to find.

### Verse 4

O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming, now to receive the anointing divine; all that I am and have I am bringing; Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

### Chorus

O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee! Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy werrtness, come in Thy fullness; stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
