## Lyrics

### Verse 1

What do I owe unto my Lord, My richest gifts can I afford? Shall I withhold my all from Thee Who gave Thy all to die for me?

### Verse 2

No wealth to give of gems or gold, Yet naught I have shall I withhold; My life, my love, my service too, To Thee alone I would be true.

### Verse 3

Upon the cross my debt was paid; On Thee, my Lord, my guilt was laid; O Thou alone may truly know How much to Thee, dear Lord, I owe.

### Chorus

What do I owe unto my Lord? My richest gifts shall I afford? whate'er I do, where'er I go, My all to Thee, dear Lord, I owe.
