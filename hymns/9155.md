# 9155 - The Truth And The Light

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who waits at the door of your heart and would enter? Whose Hand reaches out for your soul? Who pleads with you now? He's the Lord of all glory, The Savior with blessings untold.

### Verse 2

Lost soul must you wait; Heeding not the petition, Lost soul  have you waited too long? While we plead with you now; Will you vow to obey Him? Must you wait until all hope is gone?

### Chorus

Wose gentle voice calleth, "Will you hear My plea", Who bled for the wayward that day? None but the Messiah, None else could it be, The Light of salvation says "I am the Way".
