## Notation

C - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness, Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve; Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping, We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

### Verse 2

Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows, Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze; By and by the harvest and the labor ended, We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

### Verse 3

Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master, Tho' the loss sustained our spirit often grieves; When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome, We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

### Chorus

Bringing in the sheaves, Bringing in the sheaves, We shall come rejoicing, Bringing in the sheaves; Bringing in the sheaves, Bringing in the sheaves, We shall come rejoicing, Bringing in the sheaves.
