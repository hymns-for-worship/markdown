### Verse 1

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer! Sing, o earth, His wonderful love proclaim! Hail Him! Hail Him! Highest archangels in glory; strength and honor give to His holy name! Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children; in His arms He carries them all day long:

### Verse 2

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer! For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died; He, our rock, our hope of eternal salvation; Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus the crucified! Sounds His praises! Jesus, who bore our sorrows, love unbounded, wonderful, deep, and strong:

### Verse 3

Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer! Heav'nly portals loud with hosannas ring! Jesus, Savior, reigneth forever and ever; Crown Him! Corwn Him! Prophet, and Priest, and King! Christ is coming! Over the world victorious, pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong:

### Chorus

Praise Him! Praise Him! Tell of His excellent greatness; Praise Him! Praise Him! Ever in joyful song.
