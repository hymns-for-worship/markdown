## Lyrics

### Verse 1

For the fruit of all creation, Thanks be to God. For His gifts to every nation, Thanks be to God. For the plowing, sowing, reaping, Silent growth while we are sleeping, Future needs in earth's safekeeping, Thanks be to God.

### Verse 2

In the just reward of labor, God's will is done. In the help we give our neighbor, God's will is done. In our worldwide task of caring For the hungry and despairing, In the harvests we are sharing, God's will is done.

### Verse 3

For the harvests of the Spirit, Thanks be to God. For the good we all inherit, Thanks be to God. For the wonders that astound us, For the truths that still confound us, Most of all, that love has found us, Thanks be to God.
