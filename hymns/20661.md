## Notation

C - 6/4 on 6 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Where is the blessedness I knew when first I saw my Lord? Where is the soul's refreshing view, Of Jesus and His Word? What peaceful hours I once enjoyed, How sweet, their mem'ries still; But they have left an aching void, This world can never fill.

### Verse 2

Where is my God whom I adored? Does He no longer see? When e'er I lie awake and cry, Does He give ear to me? O conscience you have felt my pain, and seen my bitter tears, And seen within my sinful soul, A hot of awesome fears.

### Verse 3

And oft I've heard You say to me, "You're naught but just astray," "It's you who sought the darkest path  and spurned the brightest way;' And oft have said "Repent and turn while time belongs to you." "The hand of God will touch your soul, Your first love to renew."
