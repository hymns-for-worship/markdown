## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, and shall it ever be A mortal man ashamed of Thee? Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise, Whose glories shine thru endless days?

### Verse 2

Ashamed of Jesus? Just as soon Let midnight be ashamed of noon. 'Tis midnight with my soul till He, Bright Morning Star, bids darkness flee.

### Verse 3

Ashamed of Jesus, that dear friend On whom my hopes of heav'n depend? No; when I blush, be this my shame, That I no more revere His name.

### Verse 4

Ashamed of Jesus? Yes, I may When I've no guilt to wash away. No tear to wipe, no good to crave, No fear to quell, no soul to save.

### Verse 5

Till then nor is my boasting vain Till then I boast a Savior slain; And O, may this my glory be: That Christ is not ashamed of me.
