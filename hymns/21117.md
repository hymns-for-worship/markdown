## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We've trusted You, Dear Jesus. We've trusted in Your healing way. You promised You would once return, receiving us on judgment day. Will He not come back again? Will He not come back again?
Greater love there's never been. Will Jesus Christ come back again?

### Verse 2

Our hope is in You, Jesus. Your promises we know You'll keep. You gave Your life that we might live. Eternal life is what we seek. Will He not come back again? Will He not come back again? Greater promise there's never been. Will Jesus Christ come back again?

### Verse 3

In the twinkling of an eye, We'll be changed forever. A body new we will be given, and live with Him thereafter. Jesus will come back again. Jesus will come back again. Glorious life will then begin. When Jesus Christ comes back again.
