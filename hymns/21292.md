## Notation

E - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We walk by faith and not by sight; No gracious words we hear from Him who spoke as man ne'er spoke, But we believe Him near. 

### Verse 2

We may not touch His hands and side, Nor follow where He trod; But in His promise we rejoice, And cry "My Lord and God!"

### Verse 3

Help then, O Lord, our unbelief; And may our faith abound, To call on You when You are near And seek where You are found.

### Verse 4

That, when our life of faith is done, In realms of clearer light, We may behold You as You are, With full and endless sight.
