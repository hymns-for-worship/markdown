## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Mid the toil and strife of this busy life, Is it well with your soul? Are you living right, should you die tonight? Is it well with your soul?

### Verse 2

Have you lost your sin, are you pure within? Is it well with your soul? Are you at the side of the Crucified? Is it well with your soul?

### Verse 3

Do you praise the love of the One above? Is it well with your soul? Will the crown be won and the Lord's "well done"? Is it well with your soul?

### Chorus

Is it well with your soul? Are you free, glad and whole? Are you living right, should you die tonight? Is it well with your soul?
