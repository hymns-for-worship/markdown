## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

So softly and tenderly, Graciously speaking, The voice of the Master is heard far below, By souls all a'hunger that long His appearing, By souls all a'thirst for His goodness to know.

### Verse 2

As soft as the moonbeams o'er mountains appearing, As soft as the sunlight thru dawn breaking fair. Likewise are the ways of my Lord in His beauty, Likewise are the blessings I see ev'rywhere.

### Verse 3

O Lord see my needings before I may know them. Let my ways be Your ways as Your ways I see. Be Thou my True Master, Let me know no other, Be Thou my true keeper, Be these unto me.

### Verse 4

For I am a child and in need of Thy keeping, Without You I'd falter and I'd lose my way, And I'd lose my soul into darkness assuredly, Except that You'd show me, My way ev'ry day.
