## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I plead with You, dear Lord, I am longing to be rid of my infirmities. A thorn in the flesh You have given me. I pray that it depart from me!

### Verse 2

I know that Satan wants me to stumble so he gave me these infirmities. They're thorns in my flesh, but I now can see There's growth that You want for  me!

### Verse 3

I will take pleasure Lord, in reproach and distresses and infirmities. My thorn in the flesh will exalt Your name. I'm strong when I have been made weak!

### Chorus

You said Your grace is sufficient for me. Lord, help me undersand. You said Your strength is made perfect in weakness. Lord, help me see Your plan
