## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all."

### Verse 2

 Lord, now indeed I find Thy pow'r, and Thine alone, Can change the leper's spots, And melt the heart of stone.

### Verse 3

 And when, before the throne, I stand in Him complete, "Jesus died my soul to save," My lips shall still repeat. 

### Chorus

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
