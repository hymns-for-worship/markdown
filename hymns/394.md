# 394 - Love One Another

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Angry words! O let them never From the tongue unbridled slip; May the heart's best impulse ever Check  them ere they soil the lip. 

### Verse 2

 Love is much too pure and holy, Friendship is too sacred far, For a moment's reckless folly Thus to desolate and mar. 

### Verse 3

 Angry words are lightly spoken, Bitt'rest tho'ts are rashly stirred; Brightest links of life are broken, By a single angry word. 

### Chorus

 "Love one another," thus saith the Savior; Children, obey the Father's blest command; "Love one another," thus saith the Savior; Children obey  His blest command.
