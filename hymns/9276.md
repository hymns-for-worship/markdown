## Lyrics

### Verse 1

From ocean depths to starlit ways, Creation's wonders teach us praise; Your works reveal You to our eyes: A God who fills the earth and skies.

### Verse 2

But You, Whom earth cannot contain, Have found a humbler place to reign; Though all ceation is Your part, you dwell within each Christian heart.

### Verse 3

May we regard that splendor, too, And love Your saints as we love You, For they, and not Your works above, Contain the fullness of Your love.
