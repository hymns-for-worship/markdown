## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There's a wonderful place we call home, 'Tis a city of glory divine, It is built in the garden of rest, And that beautiful home shall be mine, O that wonderful Eden, so blest, Where Jesus, the Master has gone To prepare us this glorious home. There He bids us a welcome to come.

### Verse 2

 O how sweet it will be there to dwell With the Savior and Father of all, In a palace of diamond and gold, Where no evil to us can befall; There no sorrow that home shall invade, And our loved ones no more there shall die; One celestial, unbroken, sweet day, While eternity's ages roll by.

### Verse 3

 When the jewels of Jesus are brought, There to shine in that land of sweet song, What a beautiful, beautiful thought That I shall be there in that throng; Sweetest peace to my soul it will be, To behold such a glorious sight, Where the sun and the moon neither shine, But the glory of God is the light. light.

### Chorus

O wonderful city of God, Just across in that beautiful clime, Where the angels' sweet echo of song In musical cadences chime, O wonderful city of God By faith in the distance I see, There's a mansion prepared over there, Yes, a place in that city for me.
