## Lyrics

### Verse 1

This is the message that I bring, A message angels fain would sing: "O, be ye reconciled," Thus saith my Lord and King, "O, be ye reconciled to God." Amen

### Verse 2

 Thy word I've treasured in my heart, That I give no offence to Thee. Thou, O Jehovah, blessed art; Thy statutes teach Thou unto me. 

### Verse 3

 I with my lips have oft declared The judgments which Thy mouth hath shown. More joy Thy testimonies gave Than all the riches I have known.

### Verse 4

 I'll on Thy precepts meditate, And have respect to all Thy ways. I in Thy statutes will delight, Thy word remember all my days.
