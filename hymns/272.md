## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, the loving shepherd, calleth thee now to come into the fold of safety where there is rest and room; come in the strength of manhood, come in the morn of youth, enter the fold of safety, enter the way of truth.

### Verse 2

Jesus, the loving shepherd, gave His dear life for thee; tenderly now he's calling, wanderer come to me; haste! For without is danger, come, cries the shepherd blest; enter the fold of safety, enter the place of rest.

### Verse 3

Lingering is but folly, wolves are abroad today, seeking the sheep who're straying, seeking the lambs to slay; Jesus, the loving shepherd, calleth thee now to come; enter to fold of safety, where there is rest and room.

### Chorus

Lovingly, tenderly calling is he, wandrerer, wanderer come unto me, patiently waiting here standing I see, Jesus my shepherd divine.
