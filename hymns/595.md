## Notation

F - 3/2 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Cross of Jesus, cross of sorrow, Where the blood of Christ was shed, Perfect man on thee, did suffer, Perfect God on thee has bled!

### Verse 2

 Here the King of all the ages, Throned in light ere worlds could be, Robed in mortal flesh is dying, Crucified by sin for me. 

### Verse 3

 O mysterious condescending! O abandonment sublime! Very God Himself is bearing All the sufferings of time!

### Verse 4

 Ever more for human failure By His passion we can plead; God has borne all mortal anguish, Surely He will know our need.
