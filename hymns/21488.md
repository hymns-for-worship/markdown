## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God so loved us that He gave Christ to die upon the tree; There He suffered, bled and died, In the bitt'rest agony.

### Verse 2

Christ who made no reputation Was obedient unto death; We then, too, must learn obed'ence, As the sacred Scripture saith.


### Verse 3

If to Christ we have been faithful, As He ever bids us do, Then a heav'nly home awaits us, And to all who remain true.


### Chorus

O, what love He manifested, When He died for you and me; To the faithful He has promised, Life thru all eternity.
