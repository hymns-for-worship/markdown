## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let the weak say, "I am strong!" Let the poor say, "I am rich!" Let the blind say "I can see" It's what the Lord has done in me.

### Verse 2

In the river I will wade; There my sins are washed away; By the heaven's mercy stream Of the Savior's love for me.

### Verse 3

I will rise from water deep To the saving arms of God; I will sing salvation song; Jesus Christ has set me free. 

### Chorus

Hosanna, Hosanna To the Lamb that was slain. Hosanna, Hosanna: Jesus died and rose again.
