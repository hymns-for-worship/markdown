### Verse 1

And as they were dining, The Holy One said, As He broke into pieces, the loaf of the bread, "This loaf is My body, Not broken for few, Take, eat and remember, Twas broken for You."

### Verse 2

Yes, broken for many, And all is fulfilled; And we are reminded by the cup that He willed, That we sup and as oft as we sup, we may see, That He bled and was broken For you and for me.
