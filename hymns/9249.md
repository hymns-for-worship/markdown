## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O men of age, O men of youth, Lift up your idle swords; Come fight with us who fight for truth: The Army of our Lord.

### Verse 2

Our Lord sees ev'ry Christian die, And feels each dying breath, And calls out from a field near by, "Be faithful unto death."

### Verse 3

Our elders, long in battle years, Alas, begin to fade; But from the ranks, young men appear, And lead their first crusade.

### Verse 4

Our brethren, dead beneath the plain, Whose spirits never died, Rise up to march and shout again, "O Christ, be glorified!"

### Coda

O Christ, be glorified!
