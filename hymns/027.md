## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Joyful, joyful we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love: hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, opening to the sun above, melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away; giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the night of day.

### Verse 2

All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays, stars and angel sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise; field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea, chanting birds and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in Thee.

### Verse 3

Thou art living and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blest, wellspring of the joy of living, oceandepth of happy rest! Thou our Father, Christ our brother, all who live in love are Thine; teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.

### Verse 4

Mortals join the mighty chorus, which the morning stars began; Father love is reigning o'er us, brother love binds man to man. Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife; joyful music leads us sunward in the triumph song of life.
