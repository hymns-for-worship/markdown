# 20216 - CHRIST LIVES IN ME

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I’ve been crucified with Christ my Lord; I am dead to sin thru His precious blood; I’ve been raised to life in the Son of God; By faith I walk with Him. 

### Verse 2

Once a slave to sin, now redeemed in Christ, Renewed each day thru His sacrifice; By faith not guilty but justified, Set free to walk with Him. 

### Verse 3

Yes, He lives! Tho’ reason cannot see Eternal life in His will for me, That my steps are sure where the Spirit leads; By faith I walk with Him.

### Chorus

I live for the One who died; I live in Him who was crucified. I live and yet not I But Christ who lives in me.
