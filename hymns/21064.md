## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O the unsearchable riches of Christ! Wealth that can never be told; Riches exhaustless of mercy and grace, Precious, more precious than gold!

### Verse 2

O the unsearchable riches of Christ, Who shall their greatness declare; Jewels whose lustre our lives may adorn, Pearls that the poorest may wear!

### Verse 3

O the unsearchable riches of Christ, Freely, how freely they flow; Making the souls of the faithful and true Happy wherever they go!

### Verse 4

O the unsearchable riches of Christ! Who would not gladly endure Trials, afflictions, and crosses on earth, Riches like these to secure?

### Chorus

Precious, more precious, Wealth that can never be told! O the unsearchable riches of Christ! Precious, more precious than gold.
