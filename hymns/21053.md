# 21053 - THE CROSS IS NOT GREATER

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The cross that He gave may be heavy, But it ne'er outweighs His grace, The storm that I feared may surround me, But it ne'er excludes His face.

### Verse 2

The thorns in my path are not sharper Than composed His crown for me, The cup that I drink not more bitter Than He drank in Gethsemane.

### Verse 3

The light of His love shineth brighter, As it falls on paths of woe, The toil of my work groweth lighter, As I stoop to raise the low.

### Verse 4

His will I have joy in fulfilling, As I'm walking in His sight, My all to the blood I am bringing, It alone can keep me right.

### Chorus

The cross is not greater than His grace, The storm cannot hide His blessed face; I am satisfied to know That with Jesus here below, I can conquer ev'ry foe.
