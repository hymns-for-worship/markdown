Give ear to my appeals, O Lord, And hear my groans to You this day; Regard my cry for help, My God, For to You only do I pray; Regard my cry for help, my God, For to You only do I pray.

### Verse 2

When morning comes, O gracious Lord, You'll hear my voice, for You are great; Come morning, I will pray to You, And in Your care, I'll watch and wait; Come morning, I will pray to You, And in Your care, I'll watch and wait.
