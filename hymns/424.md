### Verse 1

Of one the Lord has made the race, Thru one has come the fall; Where sin has gone must go His grace: The Gospel is for all.

### Verse 2

 Say not the heathen are at home, Beyond we have no call; For why should we be blest alone? The Gospel is for all.


### Verse 3

 Received ye freely, freely give, From ev'ry land they call; Unless they hear they cannot live: The Gospel is for all.

### Chorus

The blessed Gospel is for all, The Gospel is for all; Where sin has gone must go His grace: The Gospel is for all.
