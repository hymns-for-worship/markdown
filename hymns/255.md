# 255 - O Love That Will Not Let Me Go

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O love that will not let me, I rest my weary soul in thee, I give thee back the life I owe, that in thine ocean depth it flow, may richer, fuller be.

### Verse 2

O light that follow'st all my way, I yield my flickering torch to thee; my heart restores its borrowed ray, that in thy sunshines glow its day may brighter, fairer be.

### Verse 3

O joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee; I trace the rainbow through the rain, and feel the promise is not vain that morn shall tearless be.

### Verse 4

O cross that liftest up my head, I dare not ask to hide from thee; I lay in dust life's glory dead, and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be.
