## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

How can I praise Thee, King of kings? Still to my soul this burden clings. Thou so great, and I so small: How can I praise Thee, Lod of all?

### Verse 2

God of all earth and heav'n above, Father of mercy, grace and love, I so weal, and Thou so strong: Patient and good, Thou suff'rest long.

### Chorus

Give me a voice to sing Thy praise; Righteous and true in all Thy ways. Beautiful song of love divine, Thankful, my Giod, that I am Thine.

### Verse 3

Giver of life and all things good, Healing my soul as no man could. Everlasting life to give, So that one frail as I might live.

### Verse 4

Sonn of Thy love Thou gave to die That the destroyer pass me by. Gave Thy word to lead me thru: Comfort, command, and promist true.
