## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Listen The word of God is calling you. Listen! God sends it forth as morning dew. Humbly take the truth that's told, Pure, refreshing to your soul. "He that hath an ear, let him hear"

### Verse 2

Tremble to see God's power and might revealed. Tremble at beauty, love and grace to heal. Let it in your heart find root, Let it grow and bear fruit.

### Verse 3

Treasure within your heart eternal light. Treasure! Its glory shines and guildes your life. Knowledge that is clear to see, Knowledge that will set you free.
