## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Brothers, now we part in Jesus, bound for service great and small; As we seek for His perfection, may His grace be with you all.

### Verse 2

Grace is all we ask to bless you, grace for pardon when you plead; If His grace is with our spirits, we can have no other need.

### Verse 3

Grace to you, so all sufficient, from our Lord and Christ above. By His grace, may we together go in peace and endless love.

### Amen

Amen.
