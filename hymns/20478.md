## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Happy day, I can say I am truly on my way, to serve Jesus for what He's done for me. Happy smile, all the while, I can go the other mile, for I know He is watching over me. I praise Jesus, the Lord of all salvation. I praise Jesus for His great sacrifice. Now I know, I can show with my face, faith, all aglow. The light of Jesus is shining thru me.

### Verse 2

Holy One, God's own Son, Yes, I know the vict'ry's won. Thank You Jesus, for what You've done for me. Holy plan, saving man, I forever take my stand With the One Who gave His dear life for me. I praise Jesus, the Lord of all salvation. I praise Jesus for His great sacrifice. Now I know, I can show with my face, faith, all aglow. The light of Jesus is shining thru me.
