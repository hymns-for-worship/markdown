### Verse 1

 Give me, O Lord, a burning heart With heav'nly love aflame, An eager longing to impart The wonders of Thy name.

 Touch Thou my lips, dear Lord, today With living coals of fire, And cleanse my wayward heart, I pray, From ev'ry vain desire.

Rekindle daily in my soul The flame of love divine, That Thy blest name I may extol And in Thy likeness shine.
