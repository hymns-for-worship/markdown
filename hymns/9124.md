## Lyrics

### Verse 3

The Lord will prosper all our ways And bless our joyful nation; O who can gather all His praise, This God of our salvation?

### Verse 1

When we embraced unrighteousness And foundered in temptation, The Lord regarded our distress And heard our lamentation.

### Verse 2

He knew us in our low estate And made our sins forgiven; Proclaim his works alone as great, And praise the God of heaven!

### Chorus

Give thanks to God, for He is good; his might is all surpassing; His mercy has forever stood; His love is everlasting.
