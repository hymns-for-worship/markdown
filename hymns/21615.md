### Verse 1

1.Â Cast thy burden on the Lord, Only lean upon His Word; Thou shalt soon have cause to bless His eternal faithfulness.



### Verse 2

Ever in the raging storm Thou shalt see His cheering form, Hear His pledge of coming aid: "It is I, be not afraid."

He will gird thee by His pow'r, In thy weary fainting hour; Lean then, loving, on His Word; Cast thy burden on the Lord.
