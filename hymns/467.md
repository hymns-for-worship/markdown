# 467 - Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus

## Notation

F - 3/4 on 3 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 O soul, are you weary and troubled? No light in the darkness you see? There's light for a look at the Savior, And life more abundant and free!

### Verse 2

 Thru death into life everlasting He passed, and we follow Him there; Over us sin no more hath dominion For more than coq'rors we are!

### Verse 3

 His word shall not fail you, He promised; Believe Him, and all will be well: Then go to a world that is dying, His perfect salvation to tell!

### Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim In the light of His glory and grace.
