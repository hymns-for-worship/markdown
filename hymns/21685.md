## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With Jesus as your Savior, His life in constant view, When some decision you should make, Ask, "What would Jesus do?"












### Verse 2

Sometimes you'll meet misfortune, The tempter will pursue; 'Tis duty whispers sweetly then, O, "What would Jesus do?"

### Verse 3

In walking life's great pathway, The wrong you would subdue, Be sure to ask the question great, O "What would Jesus do?"


### Verse 4

Your Father calls for reapers, The question now for you Is not, how long will mercy wait, But, "What would Jesus do?"

### Chorus

O "What would Jesus do?" O "What would Jesus do?" Just ask yourself the question, O "What would Jesus do?"
