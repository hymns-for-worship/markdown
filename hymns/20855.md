### Verse 1

My Lord was crucified In pain and agony; Upon the cross He bled and died To set my spirit free.

### Verse 2

A cruel, thorny crown Was placed upon His head; The blood and water mingled down As there His life was shed.

To Calvary in shame The blessed Savior trod, And He was put to death whose name Was called the Son of God.

We eat this holy bread And drink the sacred cup Of Him who for our sins was dead But now has been raised up.
