## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin; The Light of the world is Jesus; Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in, The Light of the world is Jesus.

### Verse 2

No darkness have we who in Jesus abide, The Light of the world is Jesus; We walk in the Light when we follow our Guide, The Light of the world is Jesus.

### Verse 3

Ye dwellers in darkness with sinblinded eyes, The Light of the world is Jesus; Go, wash, at His bidding and light will arise, The Light of the world is Jesus.

### Verse 4

No need of the sunlight in heaven, we're told, The Light of the world is Jesus; The Lamb is the Light of the City of Gold, The Light of the world is Jesus.

### Chorus

Come to the light, 'tis shining for thee; Sweetly the light has dawned upon me; Once I was blind, but now I can see; The Light of the world is Jesus.
