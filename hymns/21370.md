# 21370 - O CHRIST, ETERNAL SON OF GOD

## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Christ, eternal Son of God, The Lamb for sinners slain, We worship while Your head is bowed In agony and pain.

### Verse 2

None tread with You the holy place; You suffer there alone; Yours is the perfect sacrifice Which only can atone.

### Verse 3

O great High Priest, Your glory robes Are hid where none can see, And human sorrows, Son of Man, Have cloaked Your deity.

### Verse 4

The cross is sharp, but of Your woes This is the lighter part; It is our sin that pierces You And breaks Your sacred heart.

### Verse 5

Who love You most will seek Your cross And there will long abide; Now make that cross our only hope, O Jesus, crucified.
