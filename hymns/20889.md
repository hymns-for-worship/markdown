## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays, And sing the great Redeemer's praise; He justly claims a song from me His lovingkindness, O how free! Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, His lovingkindness, O how free!

### Verse 2

He saw me ruined in the fall, Yet loved me, notwithstanding all; He saved me from my lost estate His lovingkindness, O how great! Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, His lovingkindness, O how great!

### Verse 3

When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, Has gathered thick and thundered loud, He near my soul has always stood His lovingkindness, O how good! Lovingkindness, lovingkindness, His lovingkindness, O how good!
