## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Walkin' on heaven's road, gonna lay down my heavy load. Jesus said He'd walk along with me. Praise God, glory, hallelujah! I'm singin' all the way, got sunshine in ev'ry day. Won't you come along and join me on that heaven's road? Who's that walkin' down the road, carryin' such a heavy load? Sinner lay your burden down 'cause we're walkin' on heaven's road.

### Verse 2

Young folks walkin' hand in hand, singin' with the angel band. Old folk ain't so tired no more 'cause they're walkin' on heaven's road.

### Verse 3

Ain't no tears, no cryin' there, ain't no sadness anywhere. Ain't got time to shed no tears 'cause I'm walkin' on heaven's road.
