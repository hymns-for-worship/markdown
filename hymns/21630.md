## Notation

F - 3/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, teach me as You will, on this way that I go; Tell me of the wisdom beyond the world I know; That You, my allpresent God, whom my eyes cannot see, That You in mercy still care for me.





### Verse 2

So often I lose heart in my sin or my grief; I trust in Your power to help my unbelief. And You graciously bestow, from Your infinite store, New hope, Your blessing for ever more.

### Verse 3

Remind me hour by hour, till I reach my last home, That You for Your glory control the things that come, And I, grieving though I be, and too helpless to stand, Will know the comfort that You have planned.
