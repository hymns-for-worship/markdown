# 20364 - I WON'T HAVE TO CROSS JORDAN ALONE

## Notation

Eb - 6/8 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I come to the river at ending of day, When the last winds of sorrow have blown; There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way, 

### Verse 2

Oftentimes I'm forsaken, and weary and sad, When it seems that my friends have all gone; There is one tho't that cheers me and makes my heart glad, I won't have to cross Jordan alone.

### Verse 3

Tho' the billows of sorrow and trouble may sweep, Christ the Savior will care for His own; 'Till the end of the journey, my soul He will keep,

### Chorus

I won't have to cross Jordan alone, Jesus died for my sins to atone; When the darkness I see, He'll be waiting for me, I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
