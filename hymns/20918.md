## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Tho' lost in sin I did not see, How sin and death had captured me. O, blessed tho't, I'm free, I'm free, For Jesus now has rescued me.

### Verse 2

Temptations come and try my soul, To lead away is Satan's goal. O, blessed tho't, it need not be, God promises He'll help me flee.

### Verse 3

We worry over earthly things; God cares for flow'rs and birds that sing. O, blessed tho't, He cares for me; He hears my pray'r and meets my need.

### Verse 4

When life on earth shall be no more, And I can rest on heaven's shore, O, blessed tho't, O victory! I'll live with God eternally!
