## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother, in the morning bright and fair? Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother, in the hear of the noonday's glare?

### Verse 2

Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother, in the still and solemn night? Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother, for a harvest pure and white?

### Verse 3

Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother, all along the fertile way? Are you sowing the seed of the kingdom, brother? You must reap at the last great day!

### Chorus

For the harvest time is coming on, and the reapers work will soon be done; will your sheaves be many? Will your garner any, for the gath'ring at the harvest home?
