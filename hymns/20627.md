### Verse 1

My life lay shipwrecked upon life's stormy sea; Adrift and sinsick, as hopeless as could be. But Jesus found me; from sin He rescued me. He saved my soul and set me free.

### Verse 2

My Savior promised a life with all things new. He promised daily my spirit to renew; And I can tell you His promises are true. His promises for me and you.
