## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nobody knows but Jesus; 'Tis but an old refrain, But it is new to my heart, Now as it comes again.

### Verse 2

Nobody knows but Jesus; 'Tis music for today; And thru the hardest trials, Helps me along the way.

### Verse 3

Burdens might be so heavy That dear ones could not bear To know the bitter heartaches; They could not come and share.

Nobody knows but Jesus; My Lord I bless Thee now For the great gift of sorrow, That no one knows but Thou.

Nobody knows but Jesus: Is it not better so? That no one else but Jesus My own dear Lord, shall know.
