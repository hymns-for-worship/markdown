## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I stand in the glow of stars in the night, so far, so far from their glittering light. But even more brilliant are God's words to me, so close so close to my heart, I believe.

### Verse 2

I walk in His path of beauty and strength, His peace goes forth like a deep flowing stream. For when we do follow His ev'ry decree, then waves of righteousness flow like the sea.

### Verse 3

I lift up my eyes to splendor above, in awe, in awe of the depth of His love. For greater, more stirring than suns in the sky: Creator, mighty God heareth my sigh.
