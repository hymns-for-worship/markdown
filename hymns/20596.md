## Notation

F - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Remember me, Father, when this life is o'er, When struggles have ended and time is no more. A home You have promised on Jordan's fair shore, Prepared by the One who has gone on before.

### Verse 2

Revive me, O Father, create me anew To live like my Savior, to be more like You, To crucify me and the life I once knew To follow Your leading full hearted and true.

### Verse 3

Redeem me, dear Father, by His blood so pure, The blood of the Innocent given to cure My soul of its sinfulness, tattered and poor. Remember me, Father, my soul reassure.

### Chorus

O, help me, dear Father to walk as I should. So often I stumble and do as I would. Forgive me dear Father, naught in me is good. Redeem me forever by His precious blood.
