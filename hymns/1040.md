## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I would that I could paint a picture In glowing tones or lovely words, Of Him who bled and died for you. I would that I could paint a picture.

### Verse 2

I would that I could word a pray'r For you to hear how much He cares; Know Jesus intercedes for you. I would that I could word a pray'r.

### Chorus

But until then I'll tell you this There is a place you must not miss, Prepared by Him Who loves you well, More than my words or pen could tell.

### Verse 3

I would that I could write a sweet song For you to sing your whole day long; To know the joy and peace He gives, I would that I could word a sweet song.
