## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The poor in spirit are blessed, For God's kingdom they receive. Those mourning their sins are blessed, His comfort their grief relieves; O, blest are the gentle in heart. With joys on earth blessings start. O, blest are the gentle in heart, With joys on earth blessings start.

### Verse 2

Those yearning for right are blessed. A satisfied soul they gain. The merciful ones are blessed. His mercy they will obtain. O, blest are the poor ones in heart. God's favor will ne'er depart. O, blest are the pure ones in heart. God's favor will ne'er depart.

### Verse 3

Those striving for peace are blessed, For God calls them His own sons. Those suff'ring for right are blessed, In glory His chosen ones. O, blest are the lives which include Such beautiful attitudes. O, blest are the lives which include Such beautiful attitudes.
