## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee; E'en tho' it be a cross that raiseth me, still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee!

### Verse 2

Tho' like a wandrerer, the sun gone down, darkness be overme, My rest a stone, yet in my dreams I'd be, nearer, my God, to Thee!

### Verse 3

Or if, on joyful wing, cleaving the sky, sun, moon and stars forgot, upward I fly, still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee!
