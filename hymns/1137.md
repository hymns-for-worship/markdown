## Lyrics

### Verse 1

One man in his sorrow, slept; One Man knelt to pray, and wept. Peter, weakened, needing prayer; Jesus strengthened, in God's care. Alleluia!

### Verse 2

One man slept and was chastised; One Man suffered, agonized. One denied he knew His name; One professed, and now He reigns. Alleluia!

### Verse 3

One asserted his own will; One in meekness said, "Thy will." Bitterly, did Peter cry, as the Son was glorified. Alleluia!
