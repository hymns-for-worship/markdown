## Lyrics

### Verse 1

A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe; His craft and pow'r are great, and armed with cruel hate, on earth is not His equal.

### Verse 2

Did we in our own strength confide our striving would be losing; were not the right one on our side the Man of God's own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabaoth His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.

### Verse 3

And tho' this world with evil filled, should threaten to undo us; we will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us. Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also; the body they may kill: God's truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.
