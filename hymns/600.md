## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 I have one deep, supreme desire, That I may be like Jesus. To this I fervently aspire, That I may be like Jesus. I want my heart His throne to be, So that a watching world may see His likeness shining forth in me. I want to be like Jesus.

### Verse 2

 He spent His life in doing good; I want to be like Jesus. In lowly paths of service trod; I want to be like Jesus. He sympathized with hearts distressed; He spoke the words that cheered and blessed; He welcomed sinners to His breast. I want to be like Jesus. 

### Verse 3

O, perfect life of Christ my Lord! I want to be like Jesus. My recompense and my reward, That I may be like Jesus. His Spirit fill my hung'ring soul, His power all my life control; My deepest pray'r, my highest goal, That I may be like Jesus.
