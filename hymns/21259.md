## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, as we Thy saints are gathered, Bless this bread and the wine; Help us think of Jesus Christ and the precious Lamb's great sacrifice.


### Verse 2

Lord, I thank You for Your mercy, For the pain of Your loss; You gave me Your only Son so that I could find life at the cross.

### Verse 3

When my soul has found temptation, Give me strength to endure; Help me think of how He died, how the Lamb kept His soul clean and pure.

### Chorus

Help me see those sharp nails going into Your hands, Help me see the blood flow from Your side; As I take of Your Supper on this Day, Help me see that great love in Your eyes.
