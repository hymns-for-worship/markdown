## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When before the Lord I'm standing, O how sweet His voice will be; As I hear Him gently calling, "Come, you blessed unto Me."

### Verse 2

What a thrill to sing God's praises, when His face at last I see; With redeemed of all the ages and my Savior I will be.

### Verse 3

In this vale of tears I'm waiting for God's call to set me free; I'll obey His blest commandments, then the tree of life I'll see.

### Verse 4

What a precious invitation, where no sin will ever be; How I'm longing for his welcome, "Come, you blessed home with Me."

### Chorus

Come, you blessed, come, you blessed into the joy of the Lord. Come, you blessed of My Father, Heaven's treasures, your reward.
