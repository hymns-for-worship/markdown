## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O redeemed of the Lord, build Jerusalem! Set your hearts to His decree; Hear the Lord! Clear the way! He has work for you! Lift your eyes to Him and see!

### Verse 2

Stand the watch! Spread the news! Heal the sick of heart! Lift on high all those who mourn! Sing His care! Live His peace! Trust His righteous law! For His glory to adorn! Ev'ry work in His name build Jerusalem! For with ev'ry stone you raise, You lift its walls of saving grace, And hang gates of praise!

### Verse 3

Do not think you alone build Jerusalem, For our God will spread its fame. The Most high, He Himself, Will establish her, She, the city of His name! With each labor of joy, He is glorified, He, the everlasting light! Through you He build Jerusalem Your work, His delight!

### Chorus

Let us arise and build Jerusalem! Let us stand up to serve the Lord! Our God! Let us arise and build Jerusalem, Come serve, serve the Lord!
