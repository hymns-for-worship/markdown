## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Â I know that my Redeemer liveth, And that His throne shall ever stand; I know eternal life He giveth, That grace and pow'r are in His hand. 

### Verse 2

I know His promise never faileth, The word He speaks, it cannot die; Though cruel death my flesh assaileth, Yet I shall see Him by and by.

### Verse 3

I know my mansion He prepareth, That where He is, there I may be; O wondrous tho't, for me He careth, And He at last will come for me. 

### Chorus

I know, I know that Jesus liveth, And that His throne shall ever stand; I know, I know that life He giveth, That grace and pow'r are in His hand.
