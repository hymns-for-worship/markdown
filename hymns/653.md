## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 3+ - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 When Jesus comes again to gather His own, And to the true, a crown is giv'n, I want to hear Him say, "My servant, well done, Thy soul shall know the joys of heav'n."

### Verse 2

 I want to tell to all the story of love, That they may know His pardon free; And there before His throne in glory above, Receive a crown of victory.

### Verse 3

 I do not know the day my Savior will come, But I must be prepared to go; If I am ready He will call me His own, And that's enough for me to know.

### Chorus

I want to know that He will welcome me there, I do not want to be denied; I want to meet Him in that city so fair, And ever there with Him abide.
