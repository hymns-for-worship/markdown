## Lyrics

### Verse 1

On bended knee I come, With humble heart I come, Bowing down before Your holy throne; Lifting holy hands to You, As I pledge my life anew, I worship You in spirit, I worship You in truth;Make my life a holy praise unto You.

### Verse 2

On bended knee I come, With a broken heart I come, Bowing down before Your holy throne; As I look upon your face, Show your mercy and Your grace; Change my life, O Holy Spirit, Make me fresh and ever new, Make my life a holy sacrifice to You.
