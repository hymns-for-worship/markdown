## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Holy Bible, Book divine, Cherished treasure for all time; Filled with words so clear and true, Showing God's will thru and thru; Telling how we're prone to sin, Guiding pathways back to Him.

### Verse 2

Holy Bible, Book divine, Cherished treasure for all time; Pointing homeward when we stray, Leading us along His way; Shining clearly thru the night, Draw-ing us into the light.

### Verse 3

Holy Bible, Book divine, Cherished treasure for all time; Words of life, at all times near, Words of hope, forever dear; Words of love like fountains pure, Words of God that will endure.
