## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lamb of God You bought my peace; It passeth understanding. My interlude of solitude the carnal world disbanding.

### Verse 2

Here my release from strifes increase Is more than I can measure. O Lord of glory stay with me, Let worship be my pleasure.

### Verse 3

Before Your throne I stand in awe; I fall prostrate before Thee. Surrender to Your perfect law, and plead my soul completely.

### Chorus

O innocence of sacrifice, The blood that freely flowed. O Lamb Who took my sin away; O blood that makes me whole.
