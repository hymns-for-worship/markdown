### Verse 1

May my life be faced with Your great Diety. May my selfish thoughts be lost in Love, May my heart be humbled by Your Majesty And the hope that drives my soul, be You.

May I honestly face true Reality. May I live in trust to what You know. See beyond this world to Your infinity. For my death leads to eternity.
