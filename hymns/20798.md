## Notation

A - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

That dreadful night before His death, The Lamb for sinners slain, Did almost with His dying breath This solemn feast ordain.

### Verse 2

To keep the feast , Lord, we have met, And to remember Thee, Help each redeem'd one to repeat, "Forme, He died for me!"

### Verse 3

Thy suff'rings, Lord, each sacred sign, To our remembrance brings, We eat the bread and drink the wine, But think on nobler things.
