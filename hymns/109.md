# 109 - Higher Ground

## Notation

Ab - 3/4 on 2+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I'm pressing on the upward way, new heights I'm gaining everyday; still praying as I onward bound, "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

### Verse 2

My heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay; tho some may dwell where these abound, my prayer, my aim is higher ground.

### Verse 3

I want to live above the world, tho Satan's darts at me are hurled; for faith has caught the joyfull sound, the song of saints on higher ground.

### Verse 4

I want to scale the utmost height, and catch a gleam of glory bright; but still I'll pray til heav'n I've found, "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."

### Chorus

Lord, lift me up and let me stand, by faith, on heaven's table land, a higher plane than I have found; Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
