## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All the way my Savior leads me: what have I to ask beside? Can I doubt His tender mercy, who through life has been my guide? Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort, here by faith in Him to dwell! For I know whate'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well; for I know whate'er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well.

### Verse 2

All the way my Savior leads me, cheers each winding path I tread, gives me grace for every trial, feeds me with the living bread; tho my weary steps may falter, and my soul a thirst may be, gushing from the rock before me, Lo! A spring of joy I see; gushing from the rock before me, Lo! a spring of joy I see.

### Verse 3

All the way my Savior leads me: o the fullness of His love! Perfect rest to me is promised in my father's house above; when my spirit, clothed immortal, wings its flight to realms of day, this my song through endless ages: Jesus led me all the way! This my song through endless ages, Jesus led me all the way!
