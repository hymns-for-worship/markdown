## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God sends springs iinto the valleys, Flowing softly thru the hills. God sends streams down from the mountains, Leaping over rocks and rills. He fills rivers; He fills oceans. Oh! What bounty overflows! But His gift of Living Water Quenches thirst within my soul.

### Verse 2

God makes seed we plant for harvest, Grows

### Verse 3

God provides in great abundance; Of His bounty He has said: "I'll not see the saints forsaken Or the righteous begging bread, "Father, keep it still before, Greatest bounty You bestow Is the Christ, the Living Water, Bread of Life to fill my soul.
