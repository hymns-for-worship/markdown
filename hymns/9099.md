## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I survey the world in all its splendor, The heav'ns declare a beautiful array. Yes, we believe our God still rules in heaven; The darkest night He changes back to day. 

### Verse 2

Creation speaks of God in all His glory: The meadows lakes and flow'rs of ealy spring. Thru life God shows His care for ev'ry creature; Such love and pow'r inspires my heart to sing.

### Verse 3

The greatest gift God gave for our salvation; He loved the world by giving His dear Son. The sacrifice He gave for us on Calv'ry, Brings life and peace and hope to ev'ry one.

### Chorus

God's love and pow'r are shown in ev'ry scene; adorning truth on which we can rely. When time is o'er, all earth will then proclaim that Christ is Lord, and King most high.
