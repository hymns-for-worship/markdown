## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Angels from the realms of glory, Wing your flight o'er all the earth; Ye who sang creation's story, Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

### Verse 2

Shepherds in the field abiding, Watching o'er your flocks by night, God with us is now residing, Yonder shines the infant light:

### Verse 3

Sages, leave your contemplations, Brighter visions beam afar; Seek the great Desire of Nations, Ye have seen His natal star:

### Verse 4

Saints before the altar bending, Watching long in hope and fear, Suddenly the Lord, descending; In His temple shall appear.

### Chorus

Come and worship, come and worship, Worship Christ, the newborn King.
