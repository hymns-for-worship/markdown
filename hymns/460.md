## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Christ has no hands but our hands To do His work today,  He has no feet but our feet To lead men in His way; He has no tongue but our tongues To tell men how He died, He has no help but our help  To bring them to His side.

### Verse 2

 We are the only Bible The careless world will read, We are the sinner's gospel, We are the scoffers' creed; We are the Lord's last message Given in deed and word, What if the type is crooked? What if the print is blurred?

### Verse 3

 What if our hands are busy With other things than His? What if our feet are walking Where sin's allurement is? What if our tongues are speaking Of things His life would spurn, How can we hope to help Him And welcome His return?
