### Verse 1

A common love for each other, A common gift to the Savior, A common bond holding us to the Lord; A common strength when we're weary, A common hope for tomorrow, A common joy in the truth of God's Word.

### Verse 2

A common love for each other, A common gift to the Savior, A common bond holding us to the Lord; A common strength when we're weary,  Love, little children, Love one another; This is because our God is love, He is love. Keep His commandments, This is the vict'ry; The truth that overcomes the world.
