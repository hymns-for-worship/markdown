## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O spread the tidings round, wherever man is found, wherever human hearts and human woes abound; let ev'ry christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:our Lord is Lord of lords.

### Verse 2

Lo, the great King of kings, with healing in its wings, to ev'ry captive soul a full deliv'rance brings; and thro the vacant cells the song of triumph rings; our Lord is King of kings.

### Verse 3

O boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine to wond'ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine that I, in earth's decline should in His image shine! In Him, the Word of heav'n.

### Chorus

Of lords, He is the Lord! Divine, the living Word! His name, the sweetest heard; His will redemptin brings; O spread the tidings round, wherever man is found the Lord is King of kings.
