### Verse 1

What can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus; what can make me whole again, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

### Verse 2

For my portion this I see, nothing but the blood of Jesus; for my cleansing, this my plea, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

### Verse 3

Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Jesus; naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

### Verse 4

This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Jesus; this is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

### Chorus

O! precious is the flow that makes me white as snow; no other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
