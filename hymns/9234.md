## Lyrics

### Verse 1

We shall stand before the throne, Stand with all, but stand alone, Face, at last, the Aged One. God is holy; bow before Him.

### Verse 2

See the vindicated Son, Hear Him say, "Depart, Well done." Judgement sure for ev'ryone. Christ is holy; listen to Him.

### Verse 3

On His left, the doomed implore, But are locked beneath a door, There they burn forevermore. God is holy; love and fear Him.

### Verse 4

But the faithful on His right, Wearing crowns and garments white, Sing forever in His sight, "Holy, holy, Thou are holy."
