## Notation

Eb - 2/2 on 1+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He paid a debt He did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay. I needed someone to wash my sins away. And now I sing a brand new song: Amazing Grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay

### Verse 2

He paid that debt at Calvary, He cleansed my soul and set me free, I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erase; I now can sing a brand new song: Amazing Grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay

### Verse 3

One day He's coming back for me To live with Him eternally, Won't it be glory to see Him on that day! I then will sing a brand new song: Amazing Grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay
