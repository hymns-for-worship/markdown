## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Thy word is a treasure, more precious than earth's fine gold. How my heart grows richer each time the story is told!

### Verse 2

Each page holds a promise: peace, mercy, redeeming love. Each promise exalts my hope to sing praises above.

### Verse 3

Thy word is all wisdom; Thy counsel I gladly seek. Guide my understanding; open my eyes, Lord, to see.

### Verse 4

Thy word gives me comfort when sorrow seems hard to bear; A song for my journey, strength when my soul would despair.

### Verse 5

They word is eternal, tho' heaven and earth must end. Thy truth shall endure forever and ever. Amen.
