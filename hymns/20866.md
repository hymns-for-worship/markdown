## Lyrics

### Verse 1

He came to live, live a perfect life. He came to be the living Word, our Light. He came to die so we'd be reconciled. He came to rise to show His pow'r and might!

### Verse 2

He came to live, live again in us. He came to be our conqu'ring King and Friend. He came to heal and show the lost ones His love. He came to go prepare a place for us. That's why we praise Him; that's why we sing. That's why we offer Him our ev'rything. That's why we bow down and worship this King, 'cause He gave His ev'rything, 'cause He gave His ev'rything.
