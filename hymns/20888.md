## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Give to the winds your fears, In hope be undismayed; God hears thy sighs and counts your tears, God shall lift up thy head; thru waves and clouds and storms, He gently clears thy way; Wait for His time, so shall the night Soon end in joyous day.

### Verse 2

Far, far above thy tho't His counsel shall appear, when fully He the work has wrought That caused your needless fear. Leave to His sov'reign will To choose and to command; With wonder filled you then shall own How wise, how strong His hand.
