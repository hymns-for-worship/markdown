## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a stirring deep within me, could it be my time has come? Is that His voice I am hearing, come away my precious one. Is He calling me? Is He calling me? There's a stirring deep with-in me. I'll rise up, I'll rise up, Then I'll bow down, lay my crown at His precious wounded 

### Verse 2

When I see my Gracious Savior face to face when all is done. Is that His voice I am hearing, come away my precious one. Is He calling me? Is He calling me? There's a stirring deep within me. I'll rise up, I'll rise up, Then I'll bow down, lay my crown at His precious wounded
