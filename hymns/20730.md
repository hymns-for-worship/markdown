## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The sky shall unfold, preparing His entrance; The stars shall applaud Him with thunders of praise, The sweet light in His eyes shall enhance those awaiting; And we shall behold Him then face to face.

### Verse 2

The angel shall sound the shout of His coming; The sleeping shall rise from their slumbering place. And those who remain shall be changed in a moment; And we shall behold Him then face to face.

### Chorus

And we shall behold Him, We shall behold Him Face to face in all of His glory. O, we shall behold Him, We shall behold Him Face to face, our Savior and Lord.

### Coda

And we shall behold Him, Our Savior and Lord.
