## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Are you living for the Savior, as you go along life's way? Are you following His footsteps, ev'ry hour of ev'ry day? Do you contemplate the future, when by death you're called away? You should now begin to do so, do not waste another day!

### Verse 2

Look into His sacred scripture, study all He has to say, Then obey what you have learned about the straight and narrow way. Walk therein with joy and gladness, your heart filled with love and peace, Ev'ry day and hour you follow Him, your faith will be increased.

### Verse 3

You must learn to trust the Savior, take His word into your heart, And then live you life in such a way, He never will depart. Then when time on eart is over, and the judgement day has come, You will hear Him say to you at last: "My faithful child, well done."

### Chorus

This life is very fleeting, it soon shall be no more, For we all are earthly beings, bound for th'Eternal shore; There is no turning backward, it soon will be to late: For if you have not obeyed by then, you can't enter heaven's gate.
