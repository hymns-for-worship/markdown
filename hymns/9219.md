Lift up your voice to all a Savior needing. Tell them Jesus lives! Lift up your voice, for life from Him proceeding, that He freely gives.

Lift up your voice, sing out the blessed story, Of the dying Lamb. Lift up your voice, proclaim the Father's glory. He's the great I AM!

Lift up your voice, to praise the Holy Spirit, For the word, divine. Lift up your voice, let ev'ry human hear it: Jesus Christ is mine!

Lift up your voice and sing it! Sing it and tell it, again. Make ev'ry mountain ring it! Sing Hallelujah! Amen.
