### Verse 1

Let me some deed of kindness do, While this day is mine. Let me bring love's soft golden hue, While the day is mine.

May I Thy grace and mercy show, While this day is mine. May in me some new virtue grow, While this day is mine.

O Lord, forgive my foolish heart, While this day is mine. Help me to seek a fresher start, While this day is mine.
