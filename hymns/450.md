## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Yes, for me, for me He careth, With loving, tender care; Yes, with me, with me He shareth Each burden and each fear. Yes, o'er me, o'er me He watcheth, Ceaseless watcheth night and day; Yes, e'en me, e'en me He snatcheth From perils of the way.

### Verse 2

 Yes, for me, He standeth pleading At mercy's seat above, Ever for me interceding In love, untiring love. Yes, in me abroad He sheddeth Joys unearthly, love and light; And to cover me He spreadeth His loving wings of might.

### Verse 3

Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth! In me and I in Him, And my soul with hope He filleth, Tho' future plans are dim. Thus I wait for His returning, Singing all the way to heav'n; Such the joyful song of morning, Such tranquil song of ev'n.
