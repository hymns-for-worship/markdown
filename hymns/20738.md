## Notation

F - 4/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Down from his glory everliving story My God and Savior came, and Jeus was His name; Born in a manger to His own a stranger, A man of sorrows, tears and agony!

### Verse 2

What condescension, bringing us redemption, That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight, God gracious, tender laid aside His splendor, Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul!

### Verse 3

Without reluctance flesh and blood His substance He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan; O glorious myst'ry sacrifice of Calv'ry And now I know He is the great "I AM"!

### Chorus

O how I love Him! How I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all in all! The great Creator became my Savior, And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him!
