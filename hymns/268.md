## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hark, the gentle voice of Jesus falleth, tenderly upon your ear; sweet the cry of love and pity calleth, turn and listen, stay and hear.

### Verse 2

Take his yoke, for He is meek and lowly; bear his burden to him turn; he who calleth is the master holy: he will teach if you will learn.

### Verse 3

Then, his loving, tender voice obeying, bear his yoke, his burden take; find the yoke, his hand is on you laying, light and easy for his sake.

### Chorus

Ye that labor and are heavy ladened, lean upon your dear Lord's breast; ye that labor and are heavy ladened, come and I will give you rest.
