## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a place in the meadow of Glory, that my Lord has prepared long ago. He has said there's a shade, Where no sorrows invade. He has promised and I surely know. There's a place in the meadow up yonder, That by faith in our Lord we may see, If the word we obey, He will show us the way. He has promised and I know it's for me.

### Verse 2

There's a place in the meadow of Heaven, Where Your children no more there shall grieve. Be it sooner or late, You will open the gate. You have promised and Lord I believe. I believe in that meadow, Alleluia, I believe more than ever before, But I don't know the season my soul will go free, And to fly to that evergreen shore.
