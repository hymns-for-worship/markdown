## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, our Lord, how excellent and mighty; how high and holy is Thy wondrous name. O how exalted is Thy mighty glory, far up above and o'er the earth's domain.

### Verse 2

O Lord, our Lord, who dwelleth in the heaven; incline Thine ear and hear my feeble plea. Help me to serve Thee till my work is finished, then take me home, o Lord, to live with Thee.

### Verse 3

O Lord, our God, in mercy look upon me; I am unworthy of Thy tender love. O Holy One, forgive me of my sinning, and help me daily look to Thee above. 

### Coda

Amen.
