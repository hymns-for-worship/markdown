# 21494 - I'M GOING THRU, JESUS

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, I have started to walk in the light, Shining upon me from heaven so bright; I bade the world and its follies adieu, I've started in, Jesus, and I'm going thru.


### Verse 2

O, there are many who start in this race, But with the light refuse to keep pace; Others accept it because it is new, But not very many expect to go thru.


### Verse 3

I'd rather walk with Jesus alone, Have for a pillow, like Jacob, a stone; Living each moment with His face in view, Than shrink from my pathway and fail to go thru.

### Chorus

I'm going thru, yes, I'm going thru, I'll pay the price whatever others do, I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few, And I'm going thru, Jesus, I'm going thru.
