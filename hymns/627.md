## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Father, when my clumsy footsteps falter, Patiently and with demeanor mild, Stretching out Thy hands along my pathway, Thou hast led me like a little child. 

### Verse 2

 When the fearful darkness overwhelms me, When in pain I move forlorn, exiled, Seeking me with words and arms of comfort, Thou hast held me like a little child. child.

### Verse 3

 When allurements beckon me to danger, And by pleasant perils I'm beguiled, Wisdom from Thee shows the way to safety, Thou hast watched me like a little child.

### Verse 4

 Knowing Thou wilt cherish and protect me, Mend what's broken, cleanse what I've defiled; Trusting in Thy goodness without doubting, I have loved Thee like a little child.
