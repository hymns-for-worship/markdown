# 182 - I Believe In Mount Calvary

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are things as we travel thru earth's shifting sands that transcends all the reason of man; but the things that matter the most in this world, they can never be held in your hand.

### Verse 2

I believe that the Christ who was slain on that cross has the power of change lives today; for he changed me completely, a new life is mine, that is why by the cross I will stay.

### Verse 3

I believe that this life with it's great mysteries surely someday will come to an end; but the faith will conquer the darkness and death and will lead me at last to my friend.

### Chorus

I believe in a hill called mount calvary, I'll believe whatever the cost; and when time is surrendered and earth is no more, I'll still cling to that old rugged cross.
