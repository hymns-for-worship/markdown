## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Lord, help me maintain An understanding heart, So I can overcome the pain, When those I love depart. 

### Verse 2

Lord, help me understand That loved ones move away, But carry into future lands, Thy word learned yesterday.

### Verse 3

Help me remember, Lord, When loved ones fall in sin, With kindness, they can be restored, And feel Thy love again.

### Verse 4

And, Father, comfort me When loved ones pass away; Remind me, Lord, Thy children see their love another day.
