## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Encamped along the hills of light, Ye Christians soldiers, rise, And press the battle ere the night Shall veil the glowing skies. Salvation's helmet on each head, With truth all girt about, The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread And echo with our shout.

### Verse 2

Our Lord sees every Christian die, And feels each dying breath, And calls out from a field nearby, "Be faithful unto death." Our brethren, dead beneath the plain, Whose spirits never died, Rise up to march and shout again, "O Christ, be glorified." 

### Verse 3

Must  I be carried to the skies On flow'ry beds of ease, While others fought to win the prize And sailed thru bloody seas? Sure I must fight if I would reign; Increase my cour-age, Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, Supported by Thy word.
