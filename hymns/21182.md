## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame, And nothing satisfying there I found; But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came, Where springs of living water did abound.

### Verse 2

How sweet the living water from the hills of God, It makes me glad and happy all the way; Now glory, grace and blessing mark the path I've trod, I'm shouting "Hallelujah" ev'ry day.

### Verse 3

O sinner, won't you come today to Calvary? A fountain there is flowing deep and wide; The Savior now invites you to the water free, Where thirsting spirits can be satisfied.

### Chorus

Drinking at the springs of living water, Happy now am I, My soul they satisfy; Drinking at the springs of living water, O wonderful and bountiful supply.
