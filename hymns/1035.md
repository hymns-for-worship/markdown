## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Alleluia, Lord, Alleluia, O Lord, In this dark world below, in the land of the fallen, Where dreams all fade at the ending of life's day, There is hope, there is peace for the soul down-trodden in the One who is the true and living way.

### Verse 2

Alleluia, Lord, Alleluia, O Lord, In this veiled realm below, int the land of the sightless, Where truth lies hidden beneath a heart of stone, There is light for your path if you walk in the brightness of the One who guides us from His heav'nly throne.

### Chorus

Alleluia, Lord! We have seen Your glory  The exalted Son in whose name we pray; Alleluia, Lord! By Your grace and mercy lead us safely home to live with You one day.

### Coda

Alleluia, Lord, Alleluia, O Lord.
