# 21638 - THE MIRACLES OF JESUS

## Notation

C - 3/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I believe in the miracles of Jesus, How He made lame to walk, blind to see. I believe He raised Jairus' daughter. I believe He can do much for me. 



### Verse 2

I believe that He cast out dark demons. I believe that He calmed the wild sea. I believe He raised His friend Laz'rus. I believe He can do much for me.



### Verse 3

I believe He had pow'r over nature, over death and the sin that's in me. That is why I can't help but praise Him and serve Him thru eternity.



### Chorus

I believe in these signs of Jesus. I believe in Mt. Calvary. I believe that He rose up to heaven. I believe He'll come back for me.
