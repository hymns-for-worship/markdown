# 9168 - Hades' Gates Will Not Prevail

## Notation

Db - 6/4 on 6 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When Jesus said, "I'll build My church," Thus God's great wisdom He unveiled; Cleansed by Christ's blood His church began, and Hades' gates could not prevail.

### Verse 2

Man bound by sin and without hope; His Savior on the cross was nailed. But Christ arose and we will too, For Hades' gates could not prevail.

### Verse 3

When Christ burst forth from his dark tomb, The evil scheme of Satan failed. Christ's pow'r o'er death His Sonship proved, And Hades' gates could not prevail.

### Verse 4

When Jesus comes His own to claim, And raise all dead from that dark vale; Then our last foe will be destroyed, And Hades' gates will not prevail.

### Chorus

Accept God's grace. Obey His plan. There's hope in Christ for ev'ry man. He has the keys of death and hell, And Hades' gates will not prevail.
