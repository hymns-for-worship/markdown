### Verse 1

I need You, O God, I need You. For without You life's unclear. You walk beside me and always guide me. All my life, I need You near; O my God, I need You here. Without You I feel all alone; Without You I'm afraid. How could I live on? How could I go on? How could I live thru the years?
