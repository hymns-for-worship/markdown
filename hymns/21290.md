That stone is made head cornerstone, Which builders did despise. This is the doing of the LORD And wondrous in our eyes. This is the day the LORD hath made; Let us be glad and sing. Hosanna, LORD! O give success! O LORD, salvation bring!

O blessed be the one who comes, Comes in Jehovah's name; And from Jehovah's house to thee A blessing we proclaim. Thou art my God; I'll give Thee thanks. My God I'll worship Thee. O thank the LORD, for He is good; His grace will endless be.
