## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Who has held the oceans in His hands? Who has numbered ev'ry grain of sand? Kings and nations tremble at His voice. All creation rises to rejoice.

### Verse 3

Who has felt the nails upon His hand, bearing all the guilt of sinful man? God eternal, humbled to the grave, Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign! Behold our God, Seated on His throne. Come, let us adore Him. Behold our King, nothing can compare, come, let us adore Him! Let Your glory fill the earth. You will reign forever. 

### Verse 2

Who has given counsel to the Lord? Who can question any of His words? Who can teach the One who knows all things? Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?
