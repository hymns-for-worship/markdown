## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the desert blooms in gladness, When the wilderness is filled with joy, When the splendor of the mountains take your breath away, Then you will see the glory of the Lord.

### Verse 2

When the feeble hands are filled with strength again, When the knees once weak are standing strong, When the fearful heart with courage sounds the battle cry, Then you will see the glory of the Lord.
