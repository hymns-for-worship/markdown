## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Savior, bless us ere we go; Thy word into our minds instill, and make our lukewarm hearts to glow With lowly love and fervent will.



### Verse 2

Grant us, dear Lord, from evil ways True absolution and release; And bless us, more than in past days, With purity and inward peace.

### Verse 3

Do more than pardon: give us joy, Sweet fear, and sober liberty, And loving hearts without alloy That only long to be like Thee.


### Chorus

Thru life's long day, and death's dark night, O gentle Jesus, be our light.
