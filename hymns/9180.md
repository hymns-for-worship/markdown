## Lyrics

### Chorus

My destination is heaven, And Jesus will help me find the way; he'll take my hand and lead me to that city where I'll live with Him some blessed day.

### Verse 1

You may ask me where I'm going in this old world below, And how do I escape the sin that oft besets me so; I will tell you if you'll listen; There is Someone who cares, And He will help me on my way for He my journey shares.

### Verse 2

O, He hears me when I'm praying; He knows my ev'ry thought. His love for me's eternal and by His own blood I'm bought. He is always there to rescue when Satan would alarm; O, Jesus is my hope and stay, He'll keep me from all harm.

### Verse 3

Won't you come along and join me? My Lord will guide us home. Just walk the strait and narrow and you'll never be alone, For He'll never, never leave you; His way's the only one, And heaven's glory we will share when travling days are done.
