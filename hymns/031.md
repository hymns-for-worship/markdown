## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Once I was strying in sin's dark valley, no hope within could I see; God sent from heaven a loving Savior to save a poor lost soul like me.

### Verse 2

He left the Father, with all His riches, with calmness sweet and serene, came down from heaven and gave His lifeblood, to make the vilest sinner clean.

### Verse 3

Death's chilly waters I'll soon be crossing, His hand will lead me safe o'er; I'll join the chorus in that great city, and sing up there forever more.

### Chorus

O what a Savior, o hallelujah, His heart was broken on Calvary; His hands were nailscarred, His side was riven, He gave His lifeblood for even me.
