### Verse 1

My pray'r, Jehovah, hear to my entreating cry; In faithfulness, give ear, in righteousness reply. No God have I but Thee; Teach me to do Thy will; Thy spirit's good; Lead me on even pathway still.

### Verse 2

Because I trust in Thee, O, cause Thou me to hear Thy loving kindness free, when morning doth appear. Make me to know Thy way where-in my path should be; Because my soul each day do I lift up to Thee.

I close my eyes; I see His Majesty; I close my eyes, and feel His love for me.
