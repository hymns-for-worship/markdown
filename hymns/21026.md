## Notation

C - 4/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Like a lamp unto your feet, A light from heaven glows, From the land which needs no sun or moon Nor ever darkness knows, And radiant with a living splendor Makes the way so bright, You can walk, safely walk, On the upward path of right.

### Verse 2

Like a lamp unto your feet, The holy lightbeams shine, With the brightness of a cloudless sun, A glory all divine; Tho' you must go 'mong bri'rs and brambles, Nothing shall you fear, Ever walk, safely walk, In the light so white and clear.

### Verse 3

Like a lamp unto your feet, The light makes plain the way, Turning not aside where shadows linger, Lest afar you stray; Keep in the path, tho' it is stony, Never need you fall, Ever walk, safely walk, In the light that shines for all.

### Chorus

O walk, walk, walk in the light of God; In the light, the perfect light, Making plain the path of right, Walk in faith, walk in trust Up the slope where saints have trod; Keep the narrow way, Leading on to endless day, Walk in hope, walk in peace, In the perfect light of God.
