### Verse 1

Bread of the world, in mercy broken, Wine of the soul, in mercy shed, By whom the words of life were spoken, And in whose death our sins are dead.

Look on the heart by sorrow broken, Look on the tears by sinners shed; And be Your feast to us the token, That by Your grace our souls are fed.
