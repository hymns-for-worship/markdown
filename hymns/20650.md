## Lyrics

### Verse 1

That you may believe Jesus died, was buried but now He's alive, He did all these things just so you and I'd believe. The water He turned into wine, the nobleman's son, he feels fine, the lame man can walk just so you and I'd believe.

### Verse 2

The hungry crowd He did feed, He walked on the stormy sea, the blind man now sees just so you and I'd believe. He raised up His friend, Lazarus, these miracles prove now to us that Jesus is God's only Son, now I believe.
