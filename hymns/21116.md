# 21116 - GIVE ME THE WINGS OF FAITH TO RISE

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Give me the wings of faith to rise Within the veil, and see The saints above, how great their joys, How bright their glories be. Once they were mourning here below, And drenched their couch with tears: They wrestled hard, as we do now, With sins and doubts and fears.

### Verse 2

I ask them whence their vict'ry came; They, with united breath, Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb, Their triumph to His death. Our glorious leader claims our praise For His own pattern giv'n, While yet His cloud of witnesses Show the same path to heav'n.
