## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I lay my sins on Jesus, The spotless Lamb of God; He bears them all, and frees us From the accursed load. I bring my guilt to Jesus, To wash  my crimson stains White in His blood most precious, Till not a spot remains.

### Verse 2

I lay my wants on Jesus - All fullness dwells in Him; He heals all my diseases, he doth  my soul redeem. I lay my griefs on Jesus, My burdens and my cares; He from them all releases, He all my sorrows shares.

### Verse 3

I long to be like Jesus - Meek, loving, lowly, mild; I long to be like Jesus - The Father's holy Child. I long to be with Jesus, Amid the heav'nly throng, To sing with saints His praises, To learn the angels' song.
