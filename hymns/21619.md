## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O little town of Bethlehem, How still we see thee lie! Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting Light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight.



### Verse 2

How silently, how silently, The wondrous gift is giv'n! So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heav'n; No ear may hear His coming; But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him, still The dear Christ enters in.



### Verse 3

How silently, how silently, The wondrous gift is giv'n! So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heav'n; No ear may hear His coming; But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him, still The dear Christ enters in.



### Verse 4

O holy child of Bethlehem, Descend to us, we pray, Cast out our sin, and enter inâ€” Be born in us today; We hear the heav'nly angels The great glad tidings tell; O come to us, abide with us, Our Lord Emmanuel!
