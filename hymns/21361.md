## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Children of the heav'nly King, As ye journey, sweetly sing; Sing your Savior's worthy praise, Glorious in His works and ways.

### Verse 2

Shout, ye ransomed ones and blest! You on Jesus' throne shall rest; There your seat is now prepared, There your glory and reward.

### Verse 3

Lift your eyes, ye sons of light! Zion's city is in sight; There our endless home shall be, There our Lord we soon shall see.

### Verse 4

Fear not, brethren, joyful stand On the borders of your land; Jesus Christ, your Father's Son, Bids you undismayed go on.

### Verse 5

Lord, obediently we go, Gladly leaving all below; Only, Lord, our Leader be, That we still may follow Thee.
