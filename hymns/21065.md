## Notation

Ab - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O weary soul, the gate is near, In sin why still abide? Both peace and rest are waiting here And you are just outside.

### Verse 2

Forgiveness Jesus will impart, To save your soul He died; How can you still offend His heart By staying just outside?

### Verse 3

The day of life is passing by, Soon night your soul will hide; And then "too late" will be your cry, If you are just outside!

### Verse 4

Come in, be free from stains of sin, Be glad, be satisfied; Before the tempest breaks, come in, And leave your past outside.

### Chorus

Just outside the door, just outside the door, Behold it stands ajar! Just outside the door, just outside the door, So near and yet so far!
