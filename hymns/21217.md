## Lyrics

### Verse 1

All glory, laud, and honor, To Thee, Redeemer, King, To whom the lips of children Made sweet hosannas ring: Thou art the King of Israel, Thou David's royal Son, Who in the Lord's name comest, The King and blessed One.

### Verse 2

The company of angels Are praising Thee on high, And mortal men and all things Created make reply; The people of the Hebrews With palms before Thee went; Our praise and prayer and anthems Before Thee we present.

### Verse 3

To Thee, before Thy passion They sang their hymns of praise; To Thee now high exalted, Our melody we raise: Thou didst accept their praises; Accept the praise we bring, Who in all good delightest, Thou good and gracious King.
