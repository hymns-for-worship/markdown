# 368 - Rock Of Ages

## Notation

Bb - 3/4 on 3 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee; Let the water and the blood, From Thy wounded side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath and make me pure. 

### Verse 2

 Could my tears forever flow, Could my zeal no languor know, These for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone: In my hand no price I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling. 

### Verse 3

 While I draw this fleeting breath, When my eyes shall close in death, When I rise to worlds unknown, And behold Thee on Thy throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.
