# 214 - No Tears In Heaven

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

No tears in heaven, no sorrows given, all will be glory in that land; there'll be no sadness, all will be gladness, when we shall join that happy band.

### Verse 2

Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder, where he shall spend an endless day; there with our savior we'll be forever, where no more sorrow can dismay.

### Verse 3

Some morning yonder, we'll cease to ponder o'er things this life has brought to view; all will be clearer, saved ones be dearer, in heav'n where all will be made new.

### Chorus

No tears, in heaven fair, no tears no tears up there, sorrows and pain will all have flown; no tears, in heaven fair, no tears, no tears up there, no tears in heaven will be known.
