# 287 - There's A Fountain Free

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a fountain free tis for you and me let us haste o haste to its brink, tis the fount of love from the source above, and he bids us all freely drink.

### Verse 2

There's a living stream with a crystal gleam; from the throne of life now it flows, while the waters roll, let the weary soul hear the call that forth freely goes.

### Verse 3

There's a rock thatâ€™s cleft and no soul is left that may not its pure waters share, tis for you and me and its stream I see; let us hasten joyfully there.

### Chorus

Will you come, to the fountain free? Will you come, tis for you and me? Thirsty soul, hear the welcome call, tis a fountain opened to all.
