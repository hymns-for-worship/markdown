## Notation

Ab - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Yield not to temptation, For yielding is sin; Each vict'ry will help you Some other to win; Fight manful-ly onward, Dark passions subdue,

### Verse 2

 Shun evil companions, Bad language disdain, God's name hold in rev'rence, Nor take it in vain; Be thoughtful and earnest, Kind hearted and true, Look ever to Jesus: He'll carry you thru.

### Verse 3

 To him that o'ercometh, God giveth a crown; Thru faith we shall conquer, Tho' often cast down; He who is our Savior, Our strength will renew; 

### Chorus

Ask the Savior to help you, Comfort, strengthen and keep you; He is willing to aid you, He will carry you thru.
