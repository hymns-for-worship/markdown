### Verse 1

Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness! Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim; With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness, Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name!

### Verse 2

Fear not to enter His presence in poverty, Bearing no gifts to present as your own. Bring truth in its beauty and love in its purity These are the off'rings to lay at His throne.
