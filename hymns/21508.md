## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the shades of night are falling, Bringing tho'ts our hearts appalling; Voices from the darkness calling, Bring to us sweet tho'ts of home. 


### Verse 2

When our earthly homes are broken, And our last farewells are spoken, Precious hope then bears a token, Tho'ts of home, sweet tho'ts of home.

### Verse 3

Onward thru this world we wander, Shattered dreams and partings ponder, Heav'nly home just over yonder, Tho'ts of home, sweet tho'ts of home.


### Chorus

Tho'ts of home the wand'rer cheering, Ships into the port are steering, Tho'ts of home with hopes endearing, Tho'ts of home, sweet tho'ts of home.
