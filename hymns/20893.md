## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

God paints the skies with vibrant shades, And sculpts the canyon walls; He weaves each snowflake like brocade, And etches waterfalls. God quilts the mossy forest floors, And chisels rocky peaks; He sprinkles seashells on the shores, And sketches rushing creeks.

### Verse 2

God decorates with stars at night, And fills the birds with song; He carves majestic mountain heights, And forges oceans strong. God plants the wildflowers in the fields, And tints the rainbows' hues; He bids the thunderclouds to peal, And spreads the morning dews.

### Verse 3

God sews the fabric of our days, And knits us to be whole; He molds our lives like potter's clay, And purifies our souls. We are God's wondrous masterpiece; We are His workmanship. His lovingkindness we can see Thru detailed craftsmanship.

### Chorus

God's artistry is manifest Thru glorious design; How marvelous to be so blest By handiwork divine.
