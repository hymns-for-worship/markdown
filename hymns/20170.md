## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Eternal Father, strong to save, Whose arm hath bound the restless wave, Who bids the mighty ocean deep Its own appointed limits keep: O hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea.

### Verse 2

O Christ, the Lord of hill and plain o'er which our traffic runs a-main By mountain pass or valley low: Wherever, Lord, our brethren go, Protect them by Thy guarding hand From ev'ry peril on the land.

### Verse 3

O Spirit whom the Father sent To spread abroad the firmament: O wind of heaven, by Thy might Save all who dare the eagle's flight, And keep them by Thy watchful care From ev'ry peril in the air.

### Verse 4

O Trinity of love and pow'r, Our brethren shield in danger's hour; From rock and tempest, fire and foe, Protect them, wheresoe'er they go: Thus ever more shall rise to Thee Glad praise from air and land and sea. Amen
