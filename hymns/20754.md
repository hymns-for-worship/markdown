# 20754 - I KNOW THAT JESUS LOVES ME

## Notation

D - 4/4 on 4+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There are sometimes Sons of Thunder, there are stars that shine so bright; there are soldiers who take up the sword and charge into the fight. But on best of days a feeble faith is all that I can hold on to.

### Verse 2

I can watch the golden glory of the rising of the sun; I can feel the mountains tremble, I can hear the rivers run. Our God is such an awesome God, I seek His strength but I am weak.

### Chorus

And I know that Jesus loves me, He still loves me, this I know. Yes, I know that Jesus loves me, this I know.
