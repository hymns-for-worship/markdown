## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Only a boy named David, Only a little sling, Only a boy named David, but he could pray and sing. Only a boy named David, Only a rippling brook, Only a boy named David but five little stones he took. And one little sone went in the sling, And the sling went round and round. And one little stone went in the sling, And the sling went round and round; And round and round and round and round, And round and round and round. And one little stone went up in the air, And the giant came tumbling down. BOOM!
