## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O Father, draw me close to You. Calm now my spirit, peace renew. And yes, I know You hear, for You are near, For You have promised, and I believe.

### Verse 2

I lift my hand to reach Your face. Find in Your arms a hiding place, To be enfolded there within Your care, For You have promised, and I believe.

### Verse 3

I speak Your name into the night. Seek thro' the pain, Your healing light. And then I will not fear, for You are here, For You have promised, and I believe.

### Verse 4

Secure my heart, Lord, as I kneel. Make sure my trust, my all, I yield. Then I'll be one with You in all I do, For You have promised, and I believe.

### Chorus

Then I will praise Your name forever, I'll give You thanks and magnify Your loving favor. And I will tell of Your salvation, For all Your promises are true, and I believe.
