## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Be with us, God, Thro' ev'ry passing day; Guide Thou our footsteps all along the way; Help us to say "Thy will, not ours be done;" Thro'out this life, with Thee may we be one.

### Verse 2

Be with us, Christ, when sorrows dim our eyes; Focus our thought upon th'eternal prize; Grant us the peace that Thou alone canst give; And in Thy presence may we ever live.

### Verse 3

Be with us, Spirit, dwell within our hearts; Strengthen our faith for Satan's fiery darts; Fill Thou our minds with courage and with love, That we might paise Thee with the saints above.

### Verse 4

Be with us, Lord, in our last trying hour; Lead us through death by Thine almighty pow'r; Then take us home to Heaven's shining coast; Be with us, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
