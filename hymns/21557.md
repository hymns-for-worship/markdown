## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Blessed be Your name, Your glorious name; May it be exalted over all names.
You alone are LORD and You made the heavens, all of the heavens and the starry host. You made the earth and all that is on it, You made the seas from coast to coast. You give life to all of the living, and the multitudes in heaven worship You.


### Verse 2

Blessed be Your name, Your glorious name; May it be exalted over all names. You're a mighty God and Your deeds are awesome, thru all our problems Your love endures. Nothing can happen that Your eye does not see it, All of the glory and pow'r is Yours. Let us all remember Your warnings, Lord, and give us strength to obey Your word.
