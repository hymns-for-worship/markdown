## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies, I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear And wipe my weeping eyes, And wipe my weeping eyes, And wipe my weeping eyes. I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear And wipe my weeping eyes.

### Verse 2

Should earth against my soul engage And fiery darts be hurled, Then I can smile at Satan's rage And face a frowning world, And face a frowning world, And face a frowning world, Then I can smile at Satan's rage And face a frowning world.

### Verse 3

Let cares, like wild deluges come, And storms of sorrow fall! May I but safely reach my home, My God, my heav'n, my all, My God, my heav'n, my all, My God, my heav'n, my all, May I but safely reach my home, My God, my heav'n, my all.

### Verse 4

There shall I bathe my weary soul In seas of heav'nly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll Across my peaceful breast, Across my peaceful breast, Across my peaceful breast. And not a wave of trouble roll Across my peaceful breast.
