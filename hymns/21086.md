## Notation

Ab - 6/8 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Simply trusting ev'ry day, Trusting thru a stormy way, Even when my faith is small, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 2

Brightly doth His Spirit shine Into this poor heart of mine; While He leads I shall not fall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 3

Singing if my way is clear, Praying if the path be drear: If in danger, for Him call, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Verse 4

Trusting Him while life shall last, Trusting Him till earth be past, Till within the jasper wall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

### Chorus

Trusting as the moments fly, Trusting as the days go by; Trusting Him whate'er befall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.
