## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 He took my burdens all away, up to a brighter day, He gave me a song, a wonderful son; A wonderful song I now can sing, in my heart joy bells ring,  He gave me a song a wonderful song.

### Verse 2

 Brighter the way grows ev'ry day, walking the heav'nly way, He gave me a song, a wonderful song;  A wonderful song I now can sing, praises to Him, my King, He gave me a song, a wonderful song.

### Chorus

He gave me a song, to sing about, He lifted me, from sin and doubt, O, praise His name, He is my King, a wonderful song, He is to me. 

### Verse 3

 I am redeemed no more to die, never to say "goodbye," He gave me a song, a wonderful song; And some of these days in that fair land, sing with the chorus grand, He gave me a song, a wonderful song.
