### Verse 1

I have a savior, he's pleading in glory, a dear loving savior, tho earth friends be few; and now he is watching in tenderness o'er me, but o, that my savior were your savior too!

### Verse 2

I have a father to me he is given a hope for eternity blessed and true; and soon he will call me to meet him in heaven, but o, that he'd let me bring you with me too!

### Verse 3

I have a peace it is calm as a river, a peace that the friends of this world never knew; my savior alone is its author and giver and o, could I know, it was given to you!

### Chorus

For you I am praying, for you I am praying, for you I am praying, I'm praying for you.
