## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"Take up thy cross and follow me," I heard my Master say; "I gave my life to ransom thee, Surrender your all today."



### Verse 2

He drew me closer to His side, I sought His will to know, And in that will I now abide, Wherever He leads I'll go.

### Verse 3

It may be thru the shadows dim, Or o'er the stormy sea, I take my cross and follow Him, Wherever He leadeth me

### Verse 4

My heart, my life, my all I bring To Christ who loves me so; He is my Master, Lord, and King, Wherever He leads I'll go.


### Chorus

Wherever He leads I'll go, Wherever He leads I'll go, I'll follow my Christ who loves me so, Wherever He leads I'll go.
