## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus, and shall it ever be A mortal man ashamed of Thee? Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise, Whose glory shines thru endless days?

### Verse 2

Ashamed of Jesus? Sooner far Let ev'ning blush to own a star. He sheds the beams of light divine O'er this benighted soul of mine.

### Verse 3

Ashamed of Jesus, that dear Friend On whom my hopes of heav'n depend! No, when I blush, be this my shame, That I no more revere His name.

### Verse 4

Ashamed of Jesus! Yes, I may When I've no guilt to wash away. No tear to wipe, no good to crave, No fears to quell, no soul to save.

### Verse 5

Till then nor is my boasting vain Till then I'll boast a Savior slain; And O, may this my glory be: That Christ is not ashamed of me!
