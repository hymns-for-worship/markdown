## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The head that once was crowned with thorns Is crowned with glory now; A royal diadem adorns The mighty Victor's brow.

### Verse 2

The highest place that heav'n affords Is His by sov'reign right; The King of kings, and Lord of Lords, And heav'n's eternal Light.

### Verse 3

The joy of all who dwell above, The joy of all below To whom He manifests His love,And grants His name to know.

### Verse 4

The cross He bore is life and health, Tho' shame and death to Him, His people's hope, His people's wealth, Their everlasting theme.
