## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With our lips let us sing one confession, with our hearts hold to one truth alone; For He has erased our transgression, claimed us and called us His own, His very own.

### Verse 2

With our lips let us sing one confession, with our hearts hold to one truth alone; For He has erased our transgression, claimed us and called us His own, His very own. We're the people of God, called by His Name, Called from the dark and delivered from shame. One Holy race, saints ev'ry one, Because of the Blood of Christ Jesus the Son.
