## Notation

D - 3/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Light after darkness, Gain after loss, Strength after suff'ring, Crown after cross. Sweet after bitter, Song after sigh, Home after wandering, Praise after cry.


### Verse 2

Sheaves after sowing, Sun after rain, Sight after mystery, Peace after pain. Joy after sorrow, Calm after blast, Rest after weariness, Sweet rest at last.

### Verse 3

Near after distant, Gleam after gloom, Love after loneliness, Life after tomb. After long agony, Rapture of bliss! Right was the pathway Leading to this!
