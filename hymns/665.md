# 665 - Walk With Me

## Notation

Eb - 3/4 on 3 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Walk with me, walk with me, Lest mine eyes no longer see All the glory, all the story of Your love; Talk to me, talk to me, Like You spoke so tenderly, When You talked there, when You walked there by the sea.

### Verse 2

 Talk to me, talk to me, Lest mine ears no longer hear All the wonder, all the beauty of Your grace; Walk with me, walk with me, As You walked so lovingly, When You walked there, when You talked there by the sea.

### Chorus

Let me follow in the footsteps that trod the shore of Galilee, Let me learn to pray like He did in the Garden of Gethsemane; Take my hand, take my hand, Teach me Lord to understand, All the duty, all  the beauty of Your love.
