## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a sweet and blessed story Of the Christ who came from glory, Just to rescue me from sin and misery; He in lovingkindness sought me, And from sin and shame hath bro't me, Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

### Verse 2

From the depth of sin and sadness To the heights of joy and gladness Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free;With His precious blood He bought me, When I knew Him not, he sought me, And in love divine He ransomed me. 


### Verse 3

From the throne of heav'nly gloryâ€“ O, the sweet and blessed story! Jesus came to lift the lost in sin and woe Into liberty allglorious, Trophies of His grace victorious, Evermore rejoicing here below.


### Verse 4

By and by, with joy increasing, And with gratitude unceasing, Lifted up with Christ forevermore to be, I will join the hosts there singing, In the anthem ever ringing, To the King of love who ransomed me.


### Chorus

Hallelujah! What a Savior, Who can take a poor lost sinner, Lift him from the miry clay and set him free! I will ever tell the story, Shouting Glory, glory, glory, Hallelujah! Jesus lifted me.
