## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Men of faith rise up and sing of the great and glorious King. You are strong when you feel weak, in your brokenness complete.

### Verse 2

Rise up women of the truth, stand and sing to broken hearts, who can know the healing pow'r of our awesome King of love.

### Verse 3

Rise up church with broken wings, fill this place with songs again, of our God Who reigns on high, by His grace again we'll fly. Shout to the north and the south, sing to the east and the west. Jesus is Savior to all, Lord of heaven and earth.
