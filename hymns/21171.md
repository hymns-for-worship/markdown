## Notation

Eb - 4/2 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, as to Thy dear cross we flee, And plead to be forgiv'n, So let Thy life our pattern be, And form our souls for heav'n.

### Verse 2

Help us, thru good report and ill, Our daily cross to bear; Like Thee, to do our Father's will; Our brethren's grief to share.

### Verse 3

Let grace our selfishness expel, Our earthliness refine; And kindness in our bosoms dwell As free and true as Thine.

### Verse 4

If joy shall at Thy bidding fly, And grief's dark day come on, We in our turn would meekly cry, "Father, Thy will be done."

### Verse 5

Kept peaceful in the midst of strife, Forgiving and forgiv'n, O may we lead the pilgrim's life, And follow Thee to heav'n!

### Coda

Amen
