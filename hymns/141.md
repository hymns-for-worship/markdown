## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I've found my Lord and He is mine, He won me by His love; I'll serve Him all my years of time, and dwell with Him above.

### Verse 2

No other Lord but Christ I know, I walk with Him alone; His streams of love forever flow, within my heart, His throne.

### Verse 3

He's dearer to my heart than life, He found me lost in sin; He calmed the sea of inward strife, and bid me come to Him.

### Verse 4

I've tried the road of sin and found its prospects all decieve; I've proved the Lord and joys abound, more than I could believe.

### Chorus

His yoke is easy, His burden is light, I've found it so, I've found it so: His service is my sweetest delight, His blessings overflow.
