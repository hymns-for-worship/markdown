## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sweet feast of love divine! 'Tis grace that makes us free To feed upon this bread and wine, In mem'ry, Lord, of Thee

### Verse 2

Here every welcome guest Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn The secrets of Thy Father's breast, And all Thy grace discern.

### Verse 3

Here conscience ends its strife, And faith delights to prove The sweetness of the bread of life, The fullness of Thy love.

### Verse 4

Thy blood that flowed for sin, In symbol here we see, And feel the blessed pledge within, That we are loved of Thee.

### Verse 5

But if this glimpse of love Is so divinely sweet, What will it be, O Lord, above, Thy welcome smile to meet.


### Verse 6

To see Thee face to face, Thy perfect likeness wear, And all Thy ways of wondrous grace Thru endless years declare!
