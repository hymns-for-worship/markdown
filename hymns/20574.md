## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I washed my hands this morning So very clean and white; And lent them both to Jesus, To work for Him till night.

### Verse 2

I told my ears to listen Quite closely all day thru; For any act of kindness Such little hands can do.

### Verse 3

My eyes are set to watch them, About their work or play; To keep them out of mischief, For Jesus sake all day.

### Chorus

Little feet, be careful, Where ou take me to; Anything for Jesus, Only let me do.
