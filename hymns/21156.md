## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus is walking beside me, Guiding each step of the way; Safely He'll lead me to heaven, Gladly His voice I obey.

### Verse 2

He knows each turn of the pathway, He is a light for my feet; He has the power to keep me, Tho many dangers we meet.

### Verse 3

He knows my weakness and failures, And, should I linger behind, Patient is He and forgiving, So understanding and kind.

### Chorus

He lovingly guards ev'ry footstep, He tenderly cares for me; His strong arms of love are about me, My Savior and Shepherd is He.
