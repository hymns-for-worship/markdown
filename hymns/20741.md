My sins were e'er before me, brought me guilt and endless pain. Then one day the Savior found me, now I sing a glad refrain.

### Verse 2

My Savior went to Calv'ry, on the cross He bore my shame. He died from sin to cleanse me, now I praise His matchless name!

### Chorus

O, the wondrous love of Jesus! O, His grace and mercy sure! His great love will last forever; His mercy evermore endure!

### Verse 3

You too can know this Savior, take your load of guilt away. If you give your heart to Jesus, and His blessed will obey.
