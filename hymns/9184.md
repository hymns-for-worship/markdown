## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I do not desire a great mansion on earth, When promised in heaven so high. Forever to swell where the Lamb is the light, There safe to His bosom I'll fly.

### Verse 2

Oh happy the day when my journey shall end, My King ever reigns on His throne. There in that great mansion of peace and His love, When He calls me His child to come home.

### Chorus

I will joyfully say to my King; As my heart overflows with love. Thank You, Father for sending your Son; To prepare me a mansion above.

### Verse 3

We'll praise and rejoice there forever and aye. The Lord of lords, King of all kings. We'll gather around His great heavenly throne, Making beautiful melodies ring.
