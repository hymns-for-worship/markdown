### Verse 1

God the omnipotent! King, who ordainest Thunder Thy clarion, the lightning Thy sword, Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest: Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



### Verse 2

God the allmerciful! Earth hath forsaken Thy ways all holy, and slighted Thy Word; Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken: Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



### Verse 3

God the allrighteous One! Man hath defied Thee; Yet to eternity standeth Thy Word; Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee: Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



### Verse 4

God the almighty One! Widely ordaining Judgments unsearchable, famine and sword; Over the tumult of war Thou art reigning, Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.
