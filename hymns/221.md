## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies, o they tell me of a home far away; o they tell me of a home where no stormclouds rise, o they tell me of an unclouded day.

### Verse 2

O they tell me of a home where the saints have gone, o they tell me of a land far away, where the tree of life in eternal bloom sheds its fragrance in the unclouded day.

### Verse 3

O they tell me that He smiles on His children there, and His smile drives their sorrows away; and they tell me that no tears ever come again, in that lovely land of unclouded day.

### Chorus

O the land of cloudless day, o the land of unclouded sky; O they tell me of a home where no stormclouds lie, O they tell me of an unclouded day.
