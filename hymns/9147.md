## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I stand before the cross of Christ, Beneath His outstretched arms. I stand amazed at His loving grace, His care which never harms.

### Verse 2

I stand before the cross of Christ, And feel guilt deep within. I stand in shame of the debt I owe, The deadly cost of sin.

### Verse 3

I stand before the cross of Christ, His gift was so complete. I stand for him as He stood for me. His will I gladly meet.

### Verse 4

I stand before the cross of Christ, And hear Him say "forgive!" I stand redeemed by the sacrifice, And I shall always live.

### Chorus

I stand before the cross. Oh, what an awful cost! I stand before the cross, Looking up at Jesus as He died!
