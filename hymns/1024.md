### Verse 1

I need Thy presence here, Lord, stand by me, In times of joy or fear, Lord, stand by me; Who can my heart assure, My soul set free? My hope and peace is this: Lord, stand by me.

### Verse 2

With Thy strength I'm secure, Lord, stand by me; Each trial I can endure, Lord, stand by me; By Thy redeeming love, Ever I'll be Thy trusting, grateful child; Lord, stand by me.

### Verse 3

As long as life shall last, Lord, stand by me; Till sin and death are past, Lord, stand by me; Till heaven's gates appear, Thy face I see, And evermore I'm Thine; Lord, stand by me.
