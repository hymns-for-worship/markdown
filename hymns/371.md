## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Tho' dark and dreary be life's way And burdens hard to bear; There's One whose love will never fail, My heart shall ne'er despair. My hope is staid in Him today And He will safely lead, To that sweet home beyond the sea, Christ's love is all I need. 

### Verse 2

 Tho' trials press on ev'ry side And many snares there be; I look in simple faith to Him, Who calmed the stormy sea. He is the Shepherd kind and true, His sheep He'll ever feed; This cheers me on and makes me strong, Christ's love is all I need.

### Verse 3

 And when I hear the boatman's call, Come cross the chilly tide; I shall not fear to launch my bark, For Christ is at my side. He bore the sting of death for me, Has met my ev'ry need; And so I sing the sweet refrain, Christ's love is all I need. 

### Chorus

Christ's love is all I need each, I know, I know, Christ's precious love is all I need. He'll lead me safely on life's way, I know, I know Christ's precious precious love is all I need.
