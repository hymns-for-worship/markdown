## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hear me now O gentle Savior, Hear my humble plea; While to God in pray'r I'm calling, Interceed for me.

### Verse 2

Let me at Thy throne of mercy Find a sweet relief; Kneeling there in deep contrition, Help my unbelief.

### Verse 3

Trusting always in Thy merit Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded, broken spirit, save me by Thy grace.

### Verse 4

Thou the Spring of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Whom in heav'n but Thee?

### Chorus

Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While to God in pray'r I'm call-ing, Thou art always nigh.
