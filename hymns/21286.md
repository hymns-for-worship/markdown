## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I know there is a land of beautiful flowers, Where we'll meet again when life is o'er; Where we'll while away the endless hours On heaven's bright eternal shore. The prettiest beds of flowers will be blooming By the prettiest streets our eyes will ever behold Where the beautiful tree of life for us is waiting By the prettiest mansions made of purest gold.

### Verse 2

I want to meet you by that beautiful river, On that eternal morning in the sky, Where we'll live in peace thru endless ages, Where we'll never say goodbye. The prettiest robes and crowns we'll all be wearing In the city foursquare beyond this world of strife, And the prettiest song with angels we'll be singing On that beautiful morning by the river of life.
