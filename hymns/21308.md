## Lyrics

### Verse 1

ove is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist  on its  own way; it is not irritable or resentful;  it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices  with the truth. Love bears all things,  believes all things, hopes all things,  endures all things. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
