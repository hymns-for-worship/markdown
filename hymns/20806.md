## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Not no, but in the coming years, It may be in the better land, We'll read the meaning of our tears, And there, some time we'll understand.

### Verse 2

We'll catch the broken thread again, And finish what we here began; Heav'n will the mysteries explain, And then, ah then we'll understand.

### Verse 3

We'll know why clouds instead of sun Were over many cherished plan; Why song has ceased when scarce began; "Tis there, some time we'll understand.

### Verse 4

God knows the way, He holds the key, He guides us with unerring hand; Some time with tearless eyes we'll see; Yes, there, up there we'll understand.

### Chorus

Then trust in God thru all the days; Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; Tho' dark thy way, still sing and praise, Some time, some time we'll understand.
