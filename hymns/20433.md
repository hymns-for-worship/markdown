## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Are you dwelling in the sunlight? Is your path with roses strewn? Do you walk with buoyant gladness In the steps that you have hewn? Have you reached the top of Pisgah, Climbing always firm and true? Don't forget that in the valley There is someone needing you.

### Chorus

Lend a hand to help a brother Who is striving hard and true, Don't forget that in the valley There is someone needing  you.

### Verse 2

Is your day one round of pleasure, From the morn till set of sun? Know you not of pain or sorrow? Are your victories all won? Lend a hand to help your brother, Who is struggling hard and true, Don't forget that in the valley There is someone needing you.

### Verse 3

Sweet it is to dwell in sunlight, Where the shadows never rise, Where the balmy, wafting breezes Kiss the blue, o'erhanging skies; But there's always in the shadow Some poor mortal, brave and true, Don't forget that in the valley There is someone needing you.
