# 105 - I Am Thine O Lord

## Notation

Ab - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am Thine, o Lord; I have heard Thy voice, and it told Thy love to me, but I long to rise in the arms of faith, and be closer drawn to Thee.

### Verse 2

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord, by the power of grace divine; let my soul look up with a steadfast hope and my will be lost in Thine.

### Verse 3

O the pure delight of a single hour that before Thy throne I spend, when I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God, I commune as friend with friend.

### Verse 4

There are depths of love that I cannot know till I cross the narrow sea; there are heights of joy that I may not reach till I rest in peace with Thee.

### Chorus

Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord, to the cross where Thou hast died, draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord, to Thy precious bleeding side.
