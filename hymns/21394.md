## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O come, O come, Emmanuel, And ransom captive Israel That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear. 

### Verse 2

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thine advent here; Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, And death's dark shadows put to flight.

### Verse 3

O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, And order all things far and nigh; To us the path of knowledge show, And cause us in her ways to go.

### Verse 4

O come, Desire of nations, bind All peoples in one heart and mind; Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease; Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.

### Chorus

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.
