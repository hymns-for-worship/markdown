## Lyrics

### Verse 1

It seems each day we hear of war and conflict, Real peace on earth has all but disappeared. The world has turned its face away from Jesus. Yet in the Christ real peace is still secured. 

### Verse 2

We are beset with cares of life and fam'ly; Distressed by tests that we cannot control. Our lives are filled with pain and constant worries; In Jesus peace will calm a troubled soul. 

### Verse 3

It seems the world is ever more alluring With riches, fame, and things to gratify. Delights of sin are always there before us, But trust in God will give us peace of mind. 

### Chorus

There is a peace that passes understanding; There is a peace that lifts a heavy load. There is a peace that will replace a heartache.  In Jesus peace will reign within your soul. peace will reign within your soul.
