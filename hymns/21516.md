## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There is a way, the Gospel way, That leads to Heaven above; There we may eternally stay With God the Father in love.



### Verse 2

There is a way, the Lord's own way In which the Christian must strive; And always stay therein each day, So that in Heav'n we'll arrive.


### Verse 3

There is a way, the narrow way, Up which we should always go; Enter this way without delay, Joys of the Lord then you'll know.

### Chorus

"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." O, heed God's plan.
