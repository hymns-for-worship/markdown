## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I was sinking deep in sin, A lifeguard was sent from heav'n above; He came to this earth to save my soul, Redeeming it by His love. 



### Verse 2

The night was dark and waves rolled high, Our illfated craft her way had lost, When out of the storm a strong heart came To save her tho' great the cost. 



### Verse 3

He did not stop the waves of sin Which feign would our souls in death consume, But brought a new boat of stronger build To bear us above the foam. 



### Verse 4

He manned this boat with servants true, A chart and a compass both He gave, But died in a struggle with the foe Whose souls He had come to save. 



### Chorus

He died on the cross to save us from sin; His precious blood for all He shed, That all who accept His offer so free Some day to heaven might be led.
