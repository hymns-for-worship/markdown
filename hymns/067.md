## Notation

Eb - 6/4 on 1 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Lord, wilt Thou lift my feeble hand? Deep is the darkness o'er me. Give me the strength to firmly stand thru all that lies before me.

### Verse 2

Wilt Thou Thy mighty hand extend, lift me from grief to gladness? Wilt Thou my fainting soul attend, Lord, wilt Thou share my sadness?

### Verse 3

When all my earthly friends are gone, Lord wilt Thou walk beside me? I cannor find my way alone, o Savior wilt Thou guide me?

### Verse 4

Do not forsake me Lord, I pray; dark is the way and lonely. Keep Thou my feet lest I should stray, shed forth Thy love upon me.

### Chorus

O Lord, hide not Thy blessed face, I need Thee ever near me! As I approach Thy throne of grace, wilt Thou in mercy hear me?
