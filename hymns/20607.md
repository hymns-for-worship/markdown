## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I have found His grace is all complete, He supplieth ev'ry need; While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet, I am free, yes, free indeed.

### Verse 2

I have found the pleasure I once craved, It is joy and peace within; What a wondrous blessing! I am saved From the awful gulf of sin.

### Verse 3

I have found that hope so bright and clear, Living in the realm of grace; O, the Savior's presence is so near, Springing up within my soul.

### Verse 4

I have found the joy no tongue can tell, How its waves of glory roll! It is like a great o'erflowing well, Springing up within my soul.

### Chorus

It is joy unspeakable and full of glory, Full of glory, full of glory; It is joy unspeakable and full of glory, O, the half has never yet been told.
