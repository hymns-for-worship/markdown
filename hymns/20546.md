## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In our sorrow there is comfort; Tears of anguish bring release; Tho we grieve, our hopes are strengthened; In our loss, Lord, we find this peace:

### Verse 2

From our birth, our days are numbered; Tho we flourish, soon we die But with this, our hope, to waken Face to face with the risen Christ!

### Chorus

Another race is finished; A burden is laid down; The gate of heaven opens to the Sun! How precious in your sight, O lord, Is the death of a godly one.
