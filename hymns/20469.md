## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let us live so that men may see our good works, And glorify our God above. We can lead them to Jesus if our lamp is bright; Let your light shine bright and fair before all men.

### Verse 2

Are you sowing the seed of the gospel today? Can others see Him in your life? Let us teach them and guide them to heaven above, Let your light shine bright and fair before all men.

### Verse 3

You must pray as if all things depended on God, With His help you'll surely succeed; You must work as if all things depended on you, Let your light shine bright and fair before all men.

### Chorus

Let your light shine O my brother, if souls you're expecting to win, Let your light shine, they depend upon you, So let your light shine bright and fair before all men.
