Come, Lord, quickly come! Let shout and trumpet ring. Come, Lord Jesus, come! Let earth behold the King. Glory and praise, Let men and angels say. Come, quickly come! Lord Jesus, come this day!

### Verse 2

Come, Lord, quickly come! Let time and sorrow cease. Come, Lord Jesus, come! Let grave and tomb release. Break Satan's grasp. Roll ev'ry stone away. Come, quickly come! Lord Jesus, come this day!
