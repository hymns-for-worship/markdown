## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain! Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning; Zion in triumph begins her mild reign.

### Verse 2

Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! Long by the prophets of Israel foretold! Hail to the millions from bondage returning! Gentiles and Jews the blest vision behold.

### Verse 3

Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing, streams ever copious are gliding along; loud from the mountaintops echoes are ringing, wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.

### Verse 4

See, from all lands, from the isles of the ocean, praise to Jehovah ascending on high; fall'n are the engines of war and commotion, shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
