## Notation

Eb - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

"Forever with the Lord!" Amen, so let it be! Life from His death is in that word 'Tis immortality Here in the body pent, Absent from Him I roam. Yet nightly pitch my moving tent A day's march nearer home.

### Verse 2

My Father's house on high, Home of my soul, how near At times, to faith's foreseeing eye, Your golden gates appear! Ah! then my spirit faints To reach the land I love, The bright inheritance of saints, Jerusalem above.

### Verse 3

"Forever with the Lord!" Forever in His will, The promise of that faithful word, Lord, here in me fulfill. With You at my right hand, Then I shall never fail, Uphold me, Lord, and I shall stand; Thru grace I will prevail. 

### Verse 4

So when my latest breath Breaks thru the veil of pain, By death I shall escape from death, And life eternal gain. That resurrection word, That shout of victory: Once more, "Forever with the Lord!" Amen, so let it be!
