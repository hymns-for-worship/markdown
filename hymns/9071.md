## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When I think of this world God framed by His Word,  His wonders are seen ev'rywhere. Yes, the heavens declare the glory of God, His wisdom and His great pow'r.

### Verse 2

When I think of the cross where Christ gave His life, His love, greatest wonder of all. Jesus bore all my sins on Clavary's tree, His death saves me from the fall.

### Verse 3

When I think of my home in heaven above, This wonder gives hope for me here. I will sing with the saved around the white throne, And Jesus will meet me there.
