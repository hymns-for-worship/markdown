## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Sing praise to the LORD; come, sing a new song. Amid all His saints His praises prolong. Let Israel rejoice in their Maker and sing; Let children of Zion be glad in their King.

### Verse 2

In glory exult, you saints of the LORD; With songs in the night high praises record. Go forth in His service, be strong in His might To conquer all evil and stand for the right.

### Verse 3

For this is God's word: His saints shall not fail, But over the earth their pow'r shall prevail. All kingdoms and nations shall yield to their sword. Thus God shows His glory. Sing praise to the LORD!
