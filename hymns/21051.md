# 21051 - HE WILL HIDE ME

## Notation

G - 9/8 on 7 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

When the storms of life are raging, Tempests wild on sea and land, I will seek a place of refuge In the shadow of God's hand.

### Verse 2

Enemies may strive to injure, Satan all his arts employ; He will turn what seems to harm me Into everlasting joy.

### Verse 3

So, while here the cross I'm bearing, meeting storms and billows wild, Jesus for my soul is caring, Naught can harm His Father's child.

### Chorus

He will hide me, He will hide me, Where no harm can e'er betide me. He will hide me, safely hide me, In the shadow of His hand.
