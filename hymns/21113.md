## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Shepherd of tender youth, Guiding in love and truth Thru devious ways; Christ, our triumphant King, We come Your name to sing And here our children bring To join Your praise.

### Verse 2

You are our holy Lord, The allsubduing Word, Healer of strife. Yourself You did abase That from sin's deep disgrace You so might save our race And give us life.


### Verse 3

You are the great High Priest; You have prepared the feast Of holy love; And in our mortal pain None calls on You in vain; Our pleas do not disdain; Help from a-bove.


### Verse 4

Forever be our guide, Our shepherd and our pride, Our staff and song. Jesus, O Christ of God, By your enduring Word, Lead us where You have trod; Make our faith strong.


### Verse 5

So now, and till we die, Sound we Your praises high, And joyful sing: Let all the holy throng, Who to Your church belong, Unite to swell the song To Christ, our king!
