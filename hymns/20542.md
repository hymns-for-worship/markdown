## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I am so glad salvation's free to all who will receive it, Glad that the news was bro't to me when I was lost and sad; Praise His dear name, I can proclaim that truly I believe it. For I am now His child, I know, and I'm so glad.

### Verse 2

I am so glad that I can tell to wayward souls the story, Glad that by grace from day to day a helper I may be; Finding delight in service true, my soul is winning glory, Glory for Him who gave His life to rescue me.

### Verse 3

I am so glad that all my heart to Jesus I have given, Glad that at eventide my soul true sheaves to Him may bring; I will be true until with all the happy throng in heaven, Sweeter and nobler praise I give to Christ, my King.

### Chorus

Glory to Jesus, glory and honor, be to His name forever, Never a greater Friend the sinful race has had; Love Him and serve Him, love Him and praise Him; Jesus the matchless Savior; He has redeemed this soul of mine, And I'm so glad.
