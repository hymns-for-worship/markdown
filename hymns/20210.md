## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Gracious Father, Friend divine, Consolation of the blessed, You have touched this day of mine With a foretaste of Your rest. Tho' tomorrow care may come, Trial arise, and grief ensue, Now I thank You for the time I have spent in joy with You. 

### Verse 2

Should this hour of rest depart And the joy it brings me, cease, I will bear it in my heart As a promise of Your peace. When I strain beneath new woe Or contend with future sin, From this moment I may know You will bless my life again.

### Verse 3

Father, tho' I cannot see How my path will end below, Still I know You wait for me Where my heart has longed to go. When my body cannot stand, Take my spirit to your breast; With a father's gentle hands, Bear my soul to Sabbath rest.
