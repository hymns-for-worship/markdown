## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Let the word find its home in my heart. Holy word wend its way thru my heart. That wherever I go, Others looking will know, That the word found its home in my heart. Yes, the word found its home in my heart.



### Verse 2

Let the word bring its peace to my heart, Quiet word lend its peace to my heart, That when quarrels appear, Others list'ning will hear, That the word brought its peace to my heart. Yes, the word brought its peace to my heart.



### Verse 3

Let the word do its work in my heart. Mighty word send its strength thru my heart. That when tempted with sin, I will find deep within, That the word did its work in my heart. Yes, the word did its work in my heart.
