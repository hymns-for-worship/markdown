# 618 - Let Me Live Close To Thee

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 In Thy field I would wield sickles brave and true, In the fight for the right I would dare and do, Spend my days in Thy praise all the journey thru,

### Verse 2

 Not the crown nor renown that the world might see, I would work, never shirk, blessed Lord, for Thee, But to know where I go that my soul is free, Let me live close to Thee each day. 

### Verse 3

 Help me bear and to share some poor pilgrim's load, Be my friend to the end of the toilsome road, I would sing to my King in the soul's abode,

### Chorus

Let me live close to Thee, Take my hand, dear Lord, and guide me all along the rugged way; O let me live close to Thee, Let me walk and talk with Thee, dear Lord, each day.
