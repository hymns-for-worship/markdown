## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I remember when my burdens rolled away, I had carried them for years, night and day; When I sought the blessed Lord, and I took Him at His word, Then at once all my burdens rolled away.



### Verse 2

I remember where my burdens rolled away, That I feared would never leave, night or day; Jesus showed to me the loss, so I left them at the cross, I was glad when my burdens rolled away.

### Verse 3

I remember why my burdens rolled away, That had hindered me for years, night and day; As I sought the throne of grace, just a glimpse of Jesus' face, And I knew that my burdens could not stay.


### Verse 4

I am singing since my burdens rolled away, There's a song within my heart, night and day; I am living for my King, and with joy I shout and sing, Hallelujah! my burdens rolled away.


### Chorus

Rolled away, rolled away, I am happy since my burdens rolled away; Rolled away, rolled away, I am happy since my burdens rolled away.
