## Lyrics

### Verse 1

You may have the joybells ringing in your heart, And a peace that from you never will depart; Walk the straight and narrow way, Live for Jesus ev'ry day, He will keep the joybells ringing in your heart.

### Verse 2

Love of Jesus in its fullness you may know; And this love to those around you sweetly show; Words of kindness always say; Deeds of mercy do each day, Then He’ll keep the joybells ringing in your heart.

### Verse 3

You will meet with trials as you journey home; Grace sufficient He will give to overcome; Tho' unseen by mortal eye, He is with you ever nigh, And He’ll keep the joybells ringing in your heart.

### Verse 4

Let your life speak well of Jesus ev'ry day; Own His right to ev'ry service you can pay; Sinners you can help to win If your life is pure and clean, And you keep the joybells ringing in your heart.

### Chorus

Joybells ringing in your heart, Joybells ringing in your heart; Take the Savior here below With you ev'rywhere you go; He will keep the joybells ringing in your heart.
