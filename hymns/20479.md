## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Immortal, invisible, God only wise. In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

### Verse 2

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice like mountains high soaring above Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

### Verse 3

To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all; We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish: but naught changeth Thee.

### Verse 4

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight; All praise we should render: O help us to see 'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.
