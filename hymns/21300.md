# 21300 - THERE'S A WIDENESS IN GOD'S MERCY

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

There's a wideness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea. There's a kindness in God's justice, which is more than liberty. There is no place where earth's sorrows are more felt than up in heaven. There is no place where earth's failings have such kindly judgment giv'n.

### Verse 2

For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind. And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind. If our love were but more faithful, we would gladly trust God's word, And our lives reflect thanksgiving for the goodness of our Lord.
