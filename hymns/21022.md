## Lyrics

### Verse 1

With certain death in seas ahead, And Pharaoh drawing near, Salvation comes. Stand still and see. O, Israel, do not fear!

### Verse 2

With rod outstretched, the waters rise In walls on left and right. The winds will make a path for you. For you the Lord will fight!

### Verse 3

Tho horse and rider boldly come, Yet, watch from higher ground, For you will see them nevermore As waves come crashing down!

### Verse 4

The Lord, who rescued Israel, Has come redeeming you. Stand still and see what mighty work The Lord our God will do!

### Chorus

Stand still! Stand still! And fear nevermore. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord!
