## Notation

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

Jesus I've forgotten Words that You have spoken, promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim. With a doubting heart I followed paths of earthly wisdom. Forgive me for my unbelief renew the fire again.

### Verse 2

I have built an altar  where I worship things of man. I have  taken journeys that have drawn me far from You. Now I am returning lowed Your mercies ever flowing. Pardon my transgressions; help me love You again. 

### Verse 3

I have longed  to know You and all Your tender mercies, Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end. So I bow my heart before You, in the goodness of Your presence, Your grace forever shining like a beacon in the night.

### Chorus

Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me. Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
