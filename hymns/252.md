# 252 - The Home Up There

## Notation

G - 4/4 on 1 - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

This in not our rest, this is not our home, we are travelers bound for a world to come; comes full soon the end of life's little day, and our place found empty, for we fly away.

### Verse 2

To the home up there oft we turn our eyes, when some joy departs, when a dear one dies; then we vision here of a city fair, where we'll end the partings in the hope up there.

### Verse 3

Precious home up there which the Lord prepares for the ones whose names in his book appears! How our fond hearts yearn for the Lord's return, when we'll meet together in the home up there.

### Chorus

O! It won't be long til we reach our home, where no death invades, where no troubles come; where we'll sigh no more neath the loads we bear, be with Christ forever in the home up there.
