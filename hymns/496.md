# 496 - We Have An Anchor

## Notation

F - 4/4 on 4 - DO

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, When the clouds unfold their wings of strife? When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain, Will your anchor drift, or firm remain? 

### Verse 2

 It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand, For 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand; And the cables, passed from His heart to mine, Can defy the blast, thru strength divine. 

### Verse 3

 When our eyes behold thru the gath'ring night The city of gold, our harbor bright, We shall anchor fast by the heav'nly shore, With the storms all past forevermore. 

### Chorus

We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.
