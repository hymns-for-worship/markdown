## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 Each day I'll do a golden deed, By helping those who are in need; My life on earth is but a span, And so I'll do the best I can. (the best I can.) 

### Verse 2

 To be a child of God each day, My light must shine along the way; I'll sing His praise while ages roll, And strive to help some troubled soul. (some troubled soul.)

### Verse 3

 The only life that will endure, Is one that's kind and good and pure; And so for God I'll take my stand, Each day I'll lend a helping hand. (a helping hand.)

### Verse 4

 While going down life's weary road, I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load; I'll try to turn the night to day, Make flowers bloom along the way. (the lonely way.) 

### Chorus

Life's evening sun is sinking low, A few more days and I must go. To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun,
