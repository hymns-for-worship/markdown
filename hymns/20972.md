# 20972 - MY LIFE WITH CHRIST

## Notation

C - 4/4 on 3+ - SOL

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

The life I live I live in faith of Him who died upon a tree. With eyes of faith I view Him now: His suffering on Calvary.

### Verse 2

The life I live I live in hope of heavn's gate thrown open wide. For me to enter in and live forever at my Savior's side.

### Verse 3

The life I live I live in love of Him who from the first loved me. And to those round about I show this Savior dear how great is He.

### Chorus

I have been crucified with Christ; From sin have been set free. No longer is it I that live, but Jesus lives in me. No longer is it I that live but Jesus lives in me.
