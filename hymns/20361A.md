## Lyrics

### Verse 1

In His time, in His time, he makes all things beautiful, in His time. Lord, please show me ev'ry day, As You're teaching me Your way, That You do just what You say, in Your time.

### Verse 2

In Your time, in Your time, You make all things beautiful, in Your time. Lord, my life to You I bring, May each song I have to sing, Be to You a lovely thing, in Your time.

### Verse 3

In His time, in His time, He will answer all our pray'rs, in His time. Tho' the answer may not be what you think that it should be; He will answer all our needs in His time.

### Verse 4

In His time, in His time, We will someday reach our goal, in His time. Live each day with courage new, ev'ry hour His love pursue, 'Till we join in heav'n anew, in His time.
