## Lyrics

### Verse 1

O soul redeemed, rejoice, your sins are gone; That cleansing flow has washed away all wrong. Your Lord who bled and died so long ago, This very day hath washed you white as snow.

### Verse 2

O newborn soul, you've made the angels sing. Because of you, they glorify their King. Glad praises ring to heights so far above, That pierce the skies with joyous cries of love.

### Verse 3

Now join yourself with servants of our Lord, Come join the souls that love His blessed word. Receive you now that love we have for thee. Receive the joys He gives to you and me.
