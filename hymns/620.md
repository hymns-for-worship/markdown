# 620 - Room In God's Kingdom

## Notation

Bb - 4/4 on 4 - MI

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

 There is room in the kingdom of God, my brother, For the small things that you can do; Just a small, kindly deed that may cheer another Is the work God has planned for you.

### Verse 2

 Just a cup of cold water in His name given May the hope in some heart renew;  Do not wait to be told, nor by sorrow driven To the work God has planned for you.

### Verse 3

 There's a place in the service of God for workers Who are loyal to Him and true; Can't you say to Him now, "I will leave the shirkers, And the work Thou hast planned I'll do." 

### Chorus

Thee is room, there's a place In the kingdom of God for you; There is room, there's a place, There is work that we all can do.
